Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en.pdf)

[Country version:](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-country-version) Australia

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_AU/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

Terms
-----

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google LLC  
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA

1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, California 94043  
USA

Age requirements
----------------

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/02-your-relationship-with-google-lightmode.svg)

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_AU/how-our-business-works).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/03-provide-a-broad-range-of-useful-services-lightmode.svg)

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Shopping)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/04-develop-improve-and-update-google-services-lightmode.svg)

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) subject to applicable law and policies.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/05-follow-these-terms-and-service-specific-additional-terms-lightmode.svg)

The permission we give you to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/06-respect-others-lightmode.svg)

We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms#taking-action)_ section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

*   introducing malware
*   spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
*   jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/)
*   accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

*   phishing
*   creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
*   misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
*   providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

*   providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
*   using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
*   reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
*   using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
*   using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
*   hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
*   providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/07-permission-to-use-your-content-lightmode.svg)

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    *   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    *   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:
    *   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    *   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?ref=ps-terms))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

Service-related communications
------------------------------

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/09-content-in-google-services-lightmode.svg)

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/10-software-in-google-services-lightmode.svg)

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/11-in-case-of-problems-or-disagreements-lightmode.svg)

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms#toc-warranty)_ section; (2) the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific); and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.

**Don’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.**

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-liability) — but not others — under these terms.

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for:

*   fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
*   death or personal injury caused by negligence
*   gross negligence
*   willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-organization):

*   To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
*   If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-liability):
    *   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    *   indirect or consequential loss
    *   punitive damages
*   Except as stated in the _[For all users](https://policies.google.com/terms#for-all)_ section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/12-about-these-terms-lightmode.svg)

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests

Government agencies from around the world ask Google to disclose user information. We carefully review each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws. If a request asks for too much information, we try to narrow it, and in some cases we object to producing any information at all. We share the number and types of requests we receive in our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/).

The way we respond to a request depends on your Google service provider — for most of our services that’s either Google LLC, a US company operating under US law, or Google Ireland Limited, an Irish company operating under Irish law. To find which is your service provider, review Google’s [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) or check with your account administrator if your Google Account is managed by an organization.

Notifying users of requests for information
-------------------------------------------

When we receive a request from a government agency, we send an email to the user account before disclosing information. If the account is managed by an organization, we’ll give notice to the account administrator.

We won’t give notice when legally prohibited under the terms of the request. We’ll provide notice after a legal prohibition is lifted, such as when a statutory or court-ordered gag period has expired.

We might not give notice if the account has been disabled or hijacked. And we might not give notice in the case of emergencies, such as threats to a child’s safety or threats to someone’s life, in which case we’ll provide notice if we learn that the emergency has passed.

Requests for information made to Google LLC
-------------------------------------------

### Requests from US government agencies in civil, administrative, and criminal cases

The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) restrict the government’s ability to force a provider to disclose user information. US authorities must at least do the following:

*   **In all cases**: Issue a subpoena to compel disclosure of basic subscriber registration information and certain IP addresses
*   **In criminal cases**
    *   Get a court order to compel disclosure of non-content records, such as the To, From, CC, BCC, and Timestamp fields in emails
    *   Get a search warrant to compel disclosure of the content of communications, such as email messages, documents, and photos

### Requests from US government agencies in cases that involve national security

In investigations related to national security, the US government may use a National Security Letter (NSL) or one of the authorities granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to compel Google to provide user information.

*   An NSL doesn’t require judicial authorization and can only be used to compel us to provide limited subscriber information.
*   FISA orders and authorizations can be used to compel electronic surveillance and the disclosure of stored data, including content from services like Gmail, Drive, and Photos.

### Requests from government authorities outside the US

Google LLC sometimes receives data disclosure requests from government authorities outside of the US. When we receive one of these requests, we may provide user information if doing so is consistent with all of the following:

*   **US law**, which means that the access and disclosure is permitted under applicable US law, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
*   **Law of the requesting country** which means that we require the authority to follow the same due process and legal requirements that would apply if the request were made to a local provider of a similar service
*   **International norms** which means we only provide data in response to requests that satisfy the Global Network Initiative’s [Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/) and its associated implementation guidelines
*   **Google’s policies** which include any applicable terms of service and privacy policies, as well as policies related to the protection of freedom of expression

Requests for information made to Google Ireland Limited (applies if your Google service provider is Google Ireland Limited)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because Google Ireland is responsible for providing the majority of Google services in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, it also receives requests for user information.

### Requests from Irish government agencies

Google Ireland considers Irish law when evaluating requests for user information by an Irish agency. Irish law requires that Irish law enforcement authorities obtain a judicially-authorized order to compel Google Ireland to provide user information.

### Requests from government authorities outside Ireland

Google Ireland offers services to users located throughout the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and we sometimes receive data disclosure requests from government authorities outside of Ireland. In this case, we may provide user data if doing so is consistent with all of the following:

*   **Irish law**, which means that the access and disclosure is permitted under applicable Irish law, such as the Irish Criminal Justice Act
*   **European Union (EU) law applicable in Ireland**, which means any EU laws applicable in Ireland including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
*   **Law of the requesting country** which means that we require the authority to follow the same due process and legal requirements that would apply if the request were made to a local provider of a similar service
*   **International norms** which means we only provide data in response to requests that satisfy the Global Network Initiative’s [Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/) and its associated implementation guidelines
*   **Google’s policies** which include any applicable terms of service and privacy policies, as well as policies related to the protection of freedom of expression

Requests for information in emergencies
---------------------------------------

If we reasonably believe that we can prevent someone from dying or from suffering serious physical harm, we may provide information to a government agency — for example, in the case of bomb threats, school shootings, kidnappings, suicide prevention, and missing persons cases. We still consider these requests in light of applicable laws and our policies.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Effective January 5, 2022Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive)

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

Terms
-----

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google LLC

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google.Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_JP/how-our-business-works). When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_JP/how-our-business-works).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Shopping)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) subject to applicable law and policies.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

The permission we give you to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
*   don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services — for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures. When we index the web to bring you search results, we respect standard usage restrictions that website owners specify in their websites’ code, so we require the same when others use our services

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#taking-action)_ section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

*   introducing malware
*   spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
*   jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/)
*   accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

*   phishing
*   creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
*   misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
*   providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

*   providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
*   using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
*   reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
*   using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
*   using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
*   hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
*   providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-toc-terms-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    *   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    *   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:
    *   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    *   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?ref=ps-terms))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#toc-warranty)_ section; (2) the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific); and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.

**Don’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.**

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible forallows us to limit certain [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-liability) — but not others — under these terms.

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for:

*   fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
*   death or personal injury caused by negligence
*   gross negligence
*   willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-organization):

*   To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
*   If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-liability):
    *   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    *   indirect or consequential loss
    *   punitive damages
*   Except as stated in the _[For all users](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#for-all)_ section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address itfix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google reserves the right tomay suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105-20240522#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Effective January 5, 2022 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20220105/it7r24p9/google_terms_of_service_en.pdf)

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

Terms
-----

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google LLC  
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA

1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, California 94043  
USA

Age requirements
----------------

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works). When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-affiliates).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Shopping)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Nest)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) subject to applicable law and policies.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

The permission we give you to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/).

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
*   don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services — for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures. When we index the web to bring you search results, we respect standard usage restrictions that website owners specify in their websites’ code, so we require the same when others use our services

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#taking-action)_ section.

### Permission to use your content

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    *   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    *   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:
    *   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    *   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?ref=ps-terms))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#toc-warranty)_ section; (2) the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific); and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law allows us to limit certain [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-liability) — but not others — under these terms.

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct.

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-organization):

*   To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
*   If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-liability):
    *   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    *   indirect or consequential loss
    *   punitive damages
*   Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20220105#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services

*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    *   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    *   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:
    *   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    *   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?ref=ps-terms))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services

For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877).

Google content

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content.

If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page.

You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

Software in Google services

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services) include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.

When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

By law, you haveBoth the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights.

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law allows us to limit certain [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-liability) — but not others — under these terms.

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, theseThese terms don’t limit Google’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or death or personal injury caused bygross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Other than the rights and responsibilitiesliabilities described in this section (_In case of problems or disagreements_), Google won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our breachabove, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-organization), then to the extent allowed by applicable law:

*   To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’llYou’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
*   If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-liability):
    *   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    *   indirect or consequential loss
    *   punitive damages
*   Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach

If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331-20220105#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Effective March 31, 2020 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20200331/ba461e2f/google_terms_of_service_en.pdf)

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google LLC  
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA

1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, California 94043  
USA

Age requirements
----------------

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works). When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-affiliates).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Play)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Home)

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google Calendar.

### Improve Google services

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout), except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

The permission we give you to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/).

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

Many of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
*   don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://google.com/contact). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-problems)_ section.

### Permission to use your content

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:

*   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
*   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:

*   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
*   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization
--------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.

When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a [consumer](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-consumer), then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#toc-warranty)_ section, (2) stated in the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.

And unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don’t limit Google’s [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-liability) for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (_In case of problems or disagreements_), Google won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our breach of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-organization), then to the extent allowed by applicable law:

*   You’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:

*   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
*   indirect or consequential loss
*   punitive damages

*   Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach

If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20200331#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Last modified: October 25, 2017 ([view archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive))

Welcome to Google!
------------------

Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Google LLC (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.

By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

Using our Services
------------------

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.

Your Google Account
-------------------

You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.

To protect your Google Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account. Try not to reuse your Google Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google Account, [follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=58585).

Privacy and Copyright Protection
--------------------------------

Google’s [privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy) explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s policy about responding to notices [in our Help Center](https://support.google.com/bin/static.py?hl=en&ts=1114905&page=ts.cs).

Your Content in our Services
----------------------------

Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.

Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.

If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.

You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

About Software in our Services
------------------------------

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.

Modifying and Terminating our Services
--------------------------------------

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.

Our Warranties and Disclaimers
------------------------------

We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.

Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Google nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.

Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.

Liability for our Services
--------------------------

When permitted by law, Google, and Google’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.

To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Google, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).

In all cases, Google, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.

We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.

Business uses of our Services
-----------------------------

If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.

About these Terms
-----------------

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact/).

Effective March 31, 2020 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive)

### What’s covered in these terms

We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

Terms
-----

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

> Google LLC  
> organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA  
>   
> 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
> Mountain View, California 94043  
> USA

Age requirements
----------------

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_CA/how-our-business-works). When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-affiliates).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Play)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Home)

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google Calendar.

### Improve Google services

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout), except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

The permission we give you to use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/).

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

Many of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
*   don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://google.com/contact). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-problems)_ section.

### Permission to use your content

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:

*   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
*   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:

*   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
*   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/))
    
    This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization
--------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.

When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a [consumer](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-consumer), then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#toc-warranty)_ section, (2) stated in the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.

And unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don’t limit Google’s [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-liability) for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (_In case of problems or disagreements_), Google won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our breach of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific).

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-organization), then to the extent allowed by applicable law:

*   You’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:

*   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
*   indirect or consequential loss
*   punitive damages

*   Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach

If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20171025-20200331#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Last modified: October 25, 2017 ([view archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive))

Welcome to Google!
------------------

Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Google LLC (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.

By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

Using our Services
------------------

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.

Your Google Account
-------------------

You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.

To protect your Google Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account. Try not to reuse your Google Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google Account, [follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=58585).

Privacy and Copyright Protection
--------------------------------

Google’s [privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy) explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s policy about responding to notices [in our Help Center](https://support.google.com/bin/static.py?hl=en&ts=1114905&page=ts.cs).

Your Content in our Services
----------------------------

Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.

Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.

If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.

You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

About Software in our Services
------------------------------

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.

Modifying and Terminating our Services
--------------------------------------

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.

Our Warranties and Disclaimers
------------------------------

We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.

Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Google nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.

Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.

Liability for our Services
--------------------------

When permitted by law, Google, and Google’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.

To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Google, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).

In all cases, Google, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.

We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.

Business uses of our Services
-----------------------------

If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.

About these Terms
-----------------

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms.

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Last modified: April 30, 2014 ([view archived versions](https://www.google.com/policies/terms/archive/))

Welcome to Google!
------------------

Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.

By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

Using our Services
------------------

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.

Your Google Account
-------------------

You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.

To protect your Google Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account. Try not to reuse your Google Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google Account, [follow these instructions](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=58585).

Privacy and Copyright Protection
--------------------------------

Google’s [privacy policies](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s policy about responding to notices [in our Help Center](http://support.google.com/bin/static.py?hl=en&ts=1114905&page=ts.cs).

Your Content in our Services
----------------------------

Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.

Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.

If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.

You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

About Software in our Services
------------------------------

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.

Modifying and Terminating our Services
--------------------------------------

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.

Our Warranties and Disclaimers
------------------------------

We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.

Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Google nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.

Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.

Liability for our Services
--------------------------

When permitted by law, Google, and Google’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.

To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Google, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).

In all cases, Google, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.

We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.

Business uses of our Services
-----------------------------

If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.

About these Terms
-----------------

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20070416

**Welcome to Google!**

**1\. Your relationship with Google**

> 1.1 Your use of Google’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Google under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google. “Google” means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.
> 
> 1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.
> 
> 1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.
>

> > (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface for any Service; or

> 
> 2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.

**4\. Provision of the Services by Google**

> 4.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”).

You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.

> 
> 4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Google may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Google at any time, at Google’s discretion.

**5\. Use of the Services by you**

> 5.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services.

The search results that appear from Google's indices are indexed by Google's automated machinery and computers, and Google cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered. A search using Google Services may produce search results and links to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive.

Personal Use Only
-----------------

The Google Services are made available for your personal, non-commercial use only. You may not use the Google Services to sell a product or service, or to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales.

If you want to make commercial use of the Google Services, you must enter into an agreement with Google to do so in advance. Please [contact us](https://www.google.com/contact/) for more information.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Google or its licensors be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.

Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials
-------------------------------------------------

Google occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from its indices. Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that Google takes reflects the following principles:

Google's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Google cannot and does not screen anything made available through its indices. For each web site reflected in Google's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Google would consider on a case-by-case basis requests to remove the link to that site from its indices. However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.

Google stores many web pages in its cache to retrieve for users as a back-up in case the page's server temporarily fails. Site owners may block Google from returning cached versions of their pages by using the NOARCHIVE meta-tag. Site owners may also request immediate removal of cached page from the Google Search Service. Google evaluates such requests for the immediate removal of cached content on a case-by-case basis and does not guarantee that every request will be granted. The steps necessary to remove cached pages, and to prevent a site from being cached and/or included in the indices are described in the [Google FAQ](https://www.google.com/webmasters/faq.html), accessible from the home page of this site.

Miscellaneous Provisions
------------------------

These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Google.

However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.

Google stores many web pages in its cache to retrieve for users as a back-up in case the page's server temporarily fails. Site owners may block Google from returning cached versions of their pages by using the NOARCHIVE meta-tag. Site owners may also request immediate removal of cached page from the Google Search Service. Google evaluates such requests for the immediate removal of cached content on a case-by-case basis and does not guarantee that every request will be granted. The steps necessary to remove cached pages, and to prevent a site from being cached and/or included in the indices are described in the [Google FAQ](https://www.google.com/webmasters/faq.html), accessible from the home page of this site.

Miscellaneous Provisions
------------------------

These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Google.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20011217

Google Terms of Service for Your Personal Use
---------------------------------------------

Welcome! By using Google's search engine services ("Google Search Services"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service").

Content Linked to by Google
---------------------------

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Google Search Services are developed by people over whom Google exercises no control. The search results that appear from Google's indices are indexed by Google's automated machinery and computers, and Google cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered. A search using Google Search Services may produce search results and links to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot guarantee that a Google search will not locate unintended or objectionable content and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by the Google Search Services.

Personal Use Only
-----------------

The Google Search Services are made available for your personal, non-commercial use only. You may not use the Google Search Services to sell a product or service, or to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales. You may not take the results from a Google search and reformat and display them, or mirror the Google home page or results pages on your Web site. You may not "meta-search" Google. If you want to make commercial use of the Google Search Services, you must enter into an agreement with Google to do so in advance. Please [contact us](https://services.google.com/licensing/request) for more information.

If you are interested in adding a Google search box to your web site or your company's web site, [we encourage you to do so](https://www.google.com/searchcode.html).

No Automated Querying
---------------------

You may not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system without express permission in advance from Google. Note that "sending automated queries" includes, among other things:

*   using any software which sends queries to Google to determine how a website or webpage "ranks" on Google for various queries;
*   "meta-searching" Google; and
*   performing "offline" searches on Google.

Please do not write to Google to request permission to "meta-search" Google for a research project, as such requests will not be granted.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL GOOGLE BE LIABLE TO ANY USER ON ACCOUNT OF THAT USER'S USE OR MISUSE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES. ARISING FROM ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO PREVENT RECOVERY OF DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, (EVEN IF GOOGLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES).

Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials
-------------------------------------------------

Google occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from its indices. Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that Google takes reflects the following principles:

Google's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Google cannot and does not screen anything made available through its indices. For each web site reflected in Google's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Google would consider on a case-by-case basis requests to remove the link to that site from its indices.

These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Google.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms/archive/20010421

Google Terms of Service for Your Personal Use
---------------------------------------------

Welcome! By using Google's search engine services ("Google Search Services"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service").

Content Linked to by Google
---------------------------

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Google Search Services are developed by people over whom Google exercises no control. The search results that appear from Google's indices are indexed by Google's automated machinery and computers, and Google cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered. A search using Google Search Services may produce search results and links to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot guarantee that a Google search will not locate unintended or objectionable content and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by the Google Search Services.

Personal Use Only
-----------------

The Google Search Services are made available for your personal, non-commercial use only. You may not use the Google Search Services to sell a product or service, or to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales. You may not take the results from a Google search and reformat and display them, or mirror the Google home page or results pages on your Web site. You may not "meta-search" Google. If you want to make commercial use of the Google Search Services, you must enter into an agreement with Google to do so in advance. Please contact [bizdev@google.com](mailto:bizdev@google.com) for more information.

If you are interested in adding a Google search box to your web site or your company's web site, [we encourage you to do so](https://www.google.com/searchcode.html).

No Automated Querying
---------------------

You may not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system without express permission in advance from Google. Note that "automated queries" includes using any software which sends queries to Google to determine how a website "ranks" on Google for various queries.

THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. GOOGLE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIAL OR DATA THROUGH THE USE OF THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS IN THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL OR DATA.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL GOOGLE BE LIABLE TO ANY USER ON ACCOUNT OF THAT USER'S USE OR MISUSE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES. ARISING FROM ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO PREVENT RECOVERY OF DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, (EVEN IF GOOGLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES). SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES, OR FROM THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES (INCLUDING SUCH DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES). THIS LIMITATION SHALL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY REASON OF OTHER SERVICES OR GOODS RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY LINKS PROVIDED IN THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES, AS WELL AS BY REASON OF ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY LINKS PROVIDED IN THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES. THIS LIMITATION SHALL ALSO APPLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO THE COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST DATA. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL FURTHER APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES OR ANY INFORMATION OR MERCHANDISE THAT APPEARS ON, OR IS LINKED OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO, THE GOOGLE SEARCH SERVICES. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING AN FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Google be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.

Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials
-------------------------------------------------

Google occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from its indices. Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that Google takes reflects the following principles:

Google's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Google cannot and does not screen anything made available through its indices. For each web site reflected in Google's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Google would consider on a case-by-case basis requests to remove the link to that site from its indices. However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.

Google stores many web pages in its cache to retrieve for users as a back-up in case the page's server temporarily fails. Site owners may block Google from returning cached versions of their pages by using the NOARCHIVE meta-tag. Site owners may also request immediate removal of cached page from the Google Search Service. Google evaluates such requests for the immediate removal of cached content on a case-by-case basis and does not guarantee that every request will be granted. The steps necessary to remove cached pages, and to prevent a site from being cached and/or included in the indices are described in the [Google FAQ](https://www.google.com/help/faq.html), accessible from the home page of this site.

Miscellaneous Provisions
------------------------

These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Google.

Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials
-------------------------------------------------

Google occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from its indices. Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that Google takes reflects the following principles:

Google's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Google cannot and does not screen anything made available through its indices. For each web site reflected in Google's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Google would consider on a case-by-case basis requests to remove the link to that site from its indices. However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.

Google stores many web pages in its cache to retrieve for users as a back-up in case the page's server temporarily fails. If requested to do so by a site owner, Google may remove certain cached content from the Google Search Services. We evaluate requests for removal of cached content on a case-by-case basis and do not guarantee that every request will be granted. The steps necessary to prevent a site from being included in the indices and to remove cached materials are described in the [Google FAQ](https://www.google.com/faq.html), accessible from the home page of this site.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Google, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees) arising from your use of our services, your violation of the Terms of Service or your infringement, or infringement by any other user of your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.
