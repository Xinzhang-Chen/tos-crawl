[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** _We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information._

1.  An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy).
3.  "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4.  “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5.  “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6.  The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7.  “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8.  The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** _Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure._

### [1\. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

*   Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
    
*   Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.
    

### [2\. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3\. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

*   You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
*   A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
*   One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
*   You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
*   Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
*   You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4\. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

*   You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
*   You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
*   You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5\. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** _GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other._

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to._

### [1\. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2\. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3\. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4\. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5\. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6\. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7\. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent._

### [1\. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2\. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3\. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

*   You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed._

### [1\. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2\. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: [https://github.com/logos](https://github.com/logos).

### [3\. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** _You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub._

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement._

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** _Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better._

### [1\. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2\. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3\. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** _You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change._

### [1\. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2\. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

*   We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
*   If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
*   If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
*   You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3\. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5\. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly._

### [1\. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2\. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you._

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them._

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** _We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information._

1.  An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy).
3.  "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4.  “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5.  “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6.  The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7.  “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8.  The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** _Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure._

### [1\. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

*   Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
    
*   Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.
    

### [2\. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3\. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

*   You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
*   A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
*   One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
*   You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
*   Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
*   You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4\. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

*   You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
*   You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
*   You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5\. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** _GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other._

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to._

### [1\. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2\. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3\. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4\. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5\. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6\. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7\. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent._

### [1\. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2\. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3\. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

*   You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed._

### [1\. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** _You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub._

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** _You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement._

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** _Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better._

### [1\. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2\. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3\. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

**“Agreement”** means, collectively, all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that GitHub may publish from time to time on the Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Content posted on the Service will be considered Confidential Information except for Customer Content stored solely in Customer’s Private Repositories. Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving Party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing Party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing Party; (iv) the receiving Party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's Confidential Information; or (v) is or has been stored or posted on the Service and outside of Customer’s Private Repositories.

Customer may only assign one Subscription License per User across its Organizations. For clarity, once Customer assigns a Subscription License to a User, Customer is prohibited from bifurcating the Subscription License so that one User can use a Subscription License on one Organization while another User uses the same Subscription License on another Organization.

**“Support”** means technical support for the Service that GitHub may provide.

**"User"** means an individual or Machine Account who (a) accesses or uses the Service, (b) accesses or uses any part of Customer’s account; or (c) directs the use of Customer’s account in the performance of functions, in each case on Customer’s behalf.

By setting its repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer agree to allow External Users to view and Fork Customer’s repositories. If Customer sets its pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer grants to External Users a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Customer Content through the Service and to reproduce Customer Content solely on the Service as permitted through functionality provided by GitHub (for example, through Forking). Customer may grant further rights to Customer Content if Customer adopts a license. If Customer is uploading Customer Content that it did not create or own, Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Customer Content it uploads is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to External Users

### [5\. Contributions Under Repository License](#5-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever Customer adds Content to a repository containing notice of a license, it licenses that Content under the same terms and agrees that it has the right to license that Content under those terms. If Customer has a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

### [6\. Moral Rights](#6-moral-rights)

Customer retains all moral rights to Customer Content that it uploads, publishes, or submits to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, Customer waives these rights and agrees not to assert them against GitHub, solely to enable GitHub to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D, but not otherwise.

### [1\. Control](#1-control)

Customer is responsible for managing access to its Private Repositories, including invitations, administrative control of Organizations and teams, and of access.

### [3\. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access Customer's Private Repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

Customer may choose to enable additional access to its Private Repositories. For example, Customer may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Customer Content in Private Repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories as Customer’s Confidential Information. If those services or features require rights in addition to those it needs to provide the Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If Customer fails to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears, provided that for invoiced customers, paid Service features are billed in advance.

Customer may obtain additional Subscription Licenses under this Agreement by submitting a request through the Service or via its sales team. If Customer purchases the additional Subscription Licenses, Customer must pay the then-currently applicable Fees for them, prorated for the balance of the applicable Subscription Term.

For example, Customer may be a member of an Organization with its own terms or license agreements; Customer may download an application that integrates with the Service; or Customer may use the Service to authenticate to another service. While this Agreement is GitHub’s full agreement with Customer, other parties' terms govern their relationships with Customer.

### [5\. U.S. Federal Government Terms](#5-us-federal-government-terms)

If Customer is a U.S. government entity or otherwise accessing or using the Service in a government capacity, the [U.S. Federal Government Amendment](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies, and Customer agrees to its provisions.

### [3\. Privacy](#3-privacy)

The [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) and the [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms) provide detailed notice of GitHub's privacy and data use practices as well as GitHub's processing and security obligations with respect to Customer Personal Data. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from the Service must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of personal data (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If Customer collects any personal information from GitHub, Customer will only use it for the purpose for which the External User has authorized it. Customer will reasonably secure any such Personal Information, and Customer will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or External Users.

[D. Content Responsibility; Ownership; License Rights](#d-content-responsibility-ownership-license-rights)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1\. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

Customer may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. Customer is solely responsible for any User-Generated Content that it posts, uploads, links to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that User-Generated Content. GitHub is not responsible for any public display or misuse of User-Generated Content.

### [2\. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#2-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

Customer retains ownership of Customer Content that Customer creates or owns. Customer acknowledges that it: (a) is responsible for Customer Content, (b) will only submit Customer Content that Customer has the right to post (including third party or User-Generated Content), and (c) Customer will fully comply with any third-party licenses relating to Customer Content that Customer posts. Customer grants the rights set forth in Sections D.3 through D.6, free of charge and for the purposes identified in those sections until such time as Customer removes Customer Content from GitHub servers, except for Content Customer has posted publicly and that External Users have Forked, in which case the license is perpetual until such time as all Forks of Customer Content have been removed from GitHub servers. If Customer uploads Customer Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions it needs to run the Service, no additional license is required.

### [3\. License Grant to Us](#3-license-grant-to-us)

Customer grants to GitHub the right to store, archive, parse, and display Customer Content, and make incidental copies, only as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to copy Customer Content to GitHub's database and make backups; display Customer Content to Customer and those to whom Customer chooses to show it; parse Customer Content into a search index or otherwise analyze it on GitHub's servers; share Customer Content with External Users with whom Customer chooses to share it; and perform Customer Content, in case it is something like music or video. These rights apply to both public and Private Repositories. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Customer Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Customer Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Customer Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Customer Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program. Customer grants to GitHub the rights it needs to use Customer Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Customer Content as necessary to provide the Service.

### [4\. License Grant to External Users](#4-license-grant-to-external-users)

Any Content that Customer posts publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to External Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting its repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer agree to allow External Users to view and Fork Customer’s repositories. If Customer sets its pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer grants to External Users a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Customer Content through the Service and to reproduce Customer Content solely on the Service as permitted through functionality provided by GitHub (for example, through Forking). Customer may grant further rights to Customer Content if Customer adopts a license. If Customer is uploading Customer Content that it did not create or own, Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Customer Content it uploads is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to External Users

### [5\. Contributions Under Repository License](#5-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever Customer adds Content to a repository containing notice of a license, it licenses that Content under the same terms and agrees that it has the right to license that Content under those terms. If Customer has a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

### [6\. Moral Rights](#6-moral-rights)

Customer retains all moral rights to Customer Content that it uploads, publishes, or submits to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, Customer waives these rights and agrees not to assert them against GitHub, solely to enable GitHub to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D, but not otherwise.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

### [1\. Control](#1-control)

Customer is responsible for managing access to its Private Repositories, including invitations, administrative control of Organizations and teams, and of access.

### [2\. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

GitHub considers Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories to be Customer’s Confidential Information. GitHub will protect and keep strictly confidential the Customer Content of Private Repositories in accordance with Section P.

### [3\. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access Customer's Private Repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

Customer may choose to enable additional access to its Private Repositories. For example, Customer may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Customer Content in Private Repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories as Customer’s Confidential Information. If those services or features require rights in addition to those it needs to provide the Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features

Version Effective Date: April 1, 2025

When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, your Agreement with us (the "Agreement") includes the specific terms for that product or feature combined with your main agreement — the GitHub Terms of Service or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the GitHub Corporate Terms of Service or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

**For Enterprise users**

*   **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security (including Code Security and Secret Protection), Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, and Pages.
    
*   **GitHub Enterprise Server** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security (including Code Security and Secret Protection), Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, Pages, and SQL Server Images.
    

[Actions](#actions)
-------------------

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The [Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits.

Actions and any elements of the Actions product or service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the [Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration). Additionally, regardless of whether an Action is using self-hosted runners, Actions should not be used for:

*   Cryptomining;
*   Disrupting, gaining, or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/));
*   The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering the Actions product or service, or any elements of the Actions product or service, for commercial purposes;
*   Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if it’s also low burden); or
*   If using GitHub-hosted runners, any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms, or in some cases, suspension or termination of your GitHub account.

_Use for Development and Testing_

You may only access and use GitHub Actions to develop and test your application(s). Only one licensed user may access a virtual machine provided by Actions at any time.

_Authorized Developer_

You appoint GitHub as your authorized developer with respect to Apple software included in Actions. GitHub is responsible for complying with the terms for any such software included in Actions and will keep confidential any confidential information of Apple accessed as part of Actions.

_Third Party Repository Service Access_

If you grant GitHub access to your third-party repository service account(s), you authorize GitHub to scan the account(s), including the contents of your Public and Private Repositories, for purposes of providing GitHub Actions.

_Self-Hosted Runners on GitHub Actions_

If you use self-hosted runners, you have the ability to turn off automatic updates but GitHub reserves the right to override your choice for critical security updates.

[Advanced Security](#advanced-security)
---------------------------------------

GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under Advanced Security licenses. From April 1, 2025, features that were previously only available under a single GitHub Advanced Security license will be alternatively available under two separate licenses: GitHub Code Security (code scanning and dependency scanning features) and GitHub Secret Protection (secret scanning features). The [Advanced Security documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) provides more details.

Advanced Security features are licensed on a "Unique Committer" basis. A "Unique Committer" is a licensed user of GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, or GitHub Enterprise Server, who has made a commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire an appropriate GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security features on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features may also require the use of GitHub Actions.

For secret scanning with GitHub Advanced Security or GitHub Secret Protection, when you opt-in to automatic validity checks for partner patterns, exposed third-party tokens may be shared with the relevant partner, in order to provide you with more information about the validity of the token. Not all partners are based in the United States. The [Secret scanning patterns documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns) provides more details on which partners support the validity check.

[Advisory Database](#advisory-database)
---------------------------------------

The GitHub Advisory Database allows you to browse or search for vulnerabilities that affect open source projects on GitHub.

_License Grant to Us_

We need the legal right to submit your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database into public domain datasets such as the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and to license the GitHub Advisory Database under open terms for use by security researchers, the open source community, industry, and the public. You agree to release your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database under the [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

_License to the GitHub Advisory Database_

The GitHub Advisory Database is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The attribution term may be fulfilled by linking to the GitHub Advisory Database at [https://github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories) or to individual GitHub Advisory Database records used, prefixed by [https://github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories).

[Codespaces](#codespaces)
-------------------------

_Note: The github.dev service, available by pressing . on a repo or navigating directly to github.dev, is governed by GitHub's Beta Terms of service._

GitHub Codespaces enables you to develop code directly from your browser using the code within your GitHub repository. Codespaces and any elements of the Codespaces service may not be used in violation of the Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policies. Additionally, Codespaces should not be used for:

*   Cryptomining;
*   Using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any service, device, data, account or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);
*   The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Codespaces or any elements of Codespaces for commercial purposes;
*   Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Codespaces as a content delivery network, as part of a serverless application, or to host any kind of production-facing application); or
*   Any other activity unrelated to the development or testing of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Codespaces is initiated.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Codespaces, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Codespaces. Misuse of GitHub Codespaces may result in termination of your access to Codespaces, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Codespaces, or the disabling of repositories created to run Codespaces in a way that violates these Terms.

Codespaces allows you to load extensions from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace (“Marketplace Extensions”) for use in your development environment, for example, to process the programming languages that your code is written in. Marketplace Extensions are licensed under their own separate terms of use as noted in the Visual Studio Marketplace, and the terms of use located at [https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU). GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Marketplace Extensions and is not liable for actions of third-party authors of Marketplace Extensions that are granted access to Your Content. Codespaces also allows you to load software into your environment through devcontainer features. Such software is provided under the separate terms of use accompanying it. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.

The generally available version of Codespaces is not currently available for U.S. government customers. U.S. government customers may continue to use the Codespaces Beta Preview under separate terms. See [Beta Preview terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#j-beta-previews).

[Competitive Benchmarking](#competitive-benchmarking)
-----------------------------------------------------

If you offer a product or service competitive to any GitHub product or service, by using that GitHub product or service, you agree to and hereby waive any restrictions as to GitHub on competitive use and benchmark testing in the terms governing your competitive product or service. If you do not intend to waive such restrictions in your terms of use, you are not allowed to use that GitHub product or service.

[Connect](#connect)
-------------------

With GitHub Connect, you can share certain features and data between your GitHub Enterprise Server deployment and your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization or enterprise account on GitHub.com. In order to enable GitHub Connect, you must have at least one (1) account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com, and one (1) licensed deployment of GitHub Enterprise Server. Your use of GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com through Connect is governed by the terms under which you license GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com. Use of Personal Data is governed by the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

[GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)
---------------------------------

For GitHub Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise license holders, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the [GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-copilot-product-specific-terms).

To use GitHub Copilot in the CLI (Command Line Interface), you need to install the GitHub Copilot CLI extension. To use GitHub Copilot Chat on GitHub Mobile, you need to install the GitHub Mobile application. To use GitHub Copilot on the GitHub.com, you must access the website.

If you customize GitHub Copilot, to include using a GitHub Copilot Extension (Extension), your use may be subject to the terms of use and privacy policy applicable to the customization.

The code you write using GitHub Copilot is not “Content” under the Agreement until you upload it to GitHub.com. The code, functions, and other output returned to you by GitHub Copilot are called “**Suggestions**.” GitHub does not own Suggestions. You retain ownership of Your Code and you retain responsibility for Suggestions you include in Your Code. It is entirely your decision whether to use Suggestions generated by GitHub Copilot. If you use Suggestions, GitHub strongly recommends that you have reasonable policies and practices in place designed to prevent the use of a Suggestion in a way that may violate the rights of others.

_Acceptable Use_

Your use of GitHub Copilot is subject to the GitHub [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies). For example, you may not prompt GitHub Copilot with content that is unlawful or otherwise prohibited by the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies on GitHub.com. If you choose to "Allow" Copilot to provide [Suggestions matching public code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions?tool=vscode), you must comply with cited licenses.

_Data_

GitHub Copilot (i) may collect and process data based on your settings and the specific GitHub Copilot Service you use - this may include Prompts, Suggestions, and code snippets, and (ii) will collect additional usage information through the GitHub Copilot Service you use tied to your Account - this may include Service Usage Information, Website Usage Data, and Feedback Data. Upon your instructions, we may share this data with third-party applications such as those on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) or third-party AI models of your choosing. This may include personal data, as referenced in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). You can learn more about the collection and use of GitHub Copilot data in the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://copilot.github.trust.page/).

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines

Millions of developers across the world host millions of projects—both open and closed source—on GitHub. We're fortunate to be able to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day, which is a responsibility we don’t take lightly. Together, we all have the exciting opportunity to make this a community we can be proud of.

Our diverse user base brings different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and ranges from people who created their first "Hello World" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our community has to offer, while maintaining a safe place for developers to do their best work.

By outlining what we think a [safe, welcoming, and productive community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) looks like at GitHub, we hope to help you understand how best to interact and collaborate on our platform in line with our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

We encourage our community members to communicate expectations clearly, [moderate](#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you) their projects where possible, and [report](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse) any content that may violate our [policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service). GitHub Staff will investigate any reports of abuse, and may moderate public content on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service.

[Maintaining a strong community](#maintaining-a-strong-community)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.

*   **Be welcoming and open-minded** - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
    
*   **Be respectful** - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.
    
*   **Be empathetic** - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.
    

[What if something or someone offends you?](#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While some disagreements can be resolved with direct, respectful communication between community members, we understand that is not always the case. We encourage our community to contact GitHub Support through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) when they believe content or activity they’ve encountered violates our policies. However, if you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable, here are some ways GitHub enables you to take action:

*   **Communicate expectations** - Maintainers can set community-specific guidelines to help users understand how to interact with their projects, for example, in a repository’s README, [CONTRIBUTING file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors), or [dedicated code of conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project). You can find additional information on building communities on the [Communities](https://docs.github.com/en/communities) page.
    
*   **Moderate Comments** - Users with [write-access privileges](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) for a repository can [edit, delete, or hide anyone's comments](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-disruptive-comments) on commits, pull requests, and issues. Anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. Comment authors and people with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a [comment's edit history](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment). Moderating your projects can feel like a big task if there is a lot of activity, but you can [add collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-personal-account-repository#collaborator-access-for-a-repository-owned-by-a-personal-account) to assist you in managing your community.
    
*   **Lock Conversations**  - If a discussion in an issue, pull request, or commit gets out of hand, off topic, or violates your project’s code of conduct or GitHub’s policies, owners, collaborators, and anyone else with write access can put a temporary or permanent lock on the conversation. For more information, see [Locking conversations](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations).
    
*   **Block Users**  - If you encounter a specific user who you would rather not engage with, you can [block the user from your personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account) or [from your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization).
    
*   **Limit Interactions** - If your public project is getting unwanted attention, being trolled, spammed, or otherwise, you have the option of setting [temporary interaction limits](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository) to keep certain users from interacting with your repository. You can even set [code review limits](https://github.blog/2021-11-01-github-keeps-getting-better-for-open-source-maintainers/#preventing-drive-by-pull-request-approvals-and-requested-changes) to ensure quality contributions on your projects.
    

While we are passionate about empowering maintainers to moderate their own projects, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you need additional support in dealing with a situation.

[What happens if someone violates GitHub's policies?](#what-happens-if-someone-violates-githubs-policies)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We rely on reports from the community, as well as proactive detection, to help ensure that GitHub is a safe, welcoming, and productive platform for software developers. There are a variety of factors we consider when we’re made aware of behavior or content not in line with GitHub’s policies. However, our policy enforcement and content moderation approach prioritizes our vision to be the home for all developers. This means:

*   We optimize for code collaboration. We recognize that code can have multiple uses and we distinguish between how the code is being used on the platform and other possible uses. We also think about how our enforcement actions can affect a potentially complicated web of interdependencies across the platform and aim to restrict as little legitimate content as possible.
    
*   We take a human-centered approach to content moderation and we tailor our responses to meet the needs of a specific situation. Our global team investigates the reports we receive on a case-by-case basis—considering context and the surrounding facts—before taking action. This could include taking into account potentially offensive content being posted in a way that lacks context or makes it easy for other users to unwittingly view or interact with while using GitHub. In those instances, we may favor moderation in order to safeguard our community.
    
*   Our decisions are rooted in our core belief that serving an interconnected community and empowering human progress through developer collaboration requires a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging.
    

Where we have decided that moderation action is warranted, these are some of the ways we may respond:

*   Removing the offending content
*   Blocking or disabling the offending content
*   Downgrading the visibility of the offending content
*   Hiding a user account or organization from public view
*   Suspending a user account or organization

[Appeal and Reinstatement](#appeal-and-reinstatement)
-----------------------------------------------------

If your content or account has been disabled or restricted and you seek reinstatement or wish to appeal, please see our [Appeal and Reinstatement page](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement) for information about the process and use our [Appeal and Reinstatement form](https://support.github.com/contact/reinstatement) to submit a request.

[Overview and Purpose](#overview-and-purpose)
---------------------------------------------

Millions of developers across the world host millions of projects—both open and closed source—on GitHub. We're fortunate to be able to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day, which is a responsibility we don’t take lightly. Together, we all have the exciting opportunity to make this a community we can be proud of.

GitHub Community, powered by GitHub Discussions, is intended to be a place for further collaboration, support, and brainstorming. This is a civilized place for connecting with other users, learning new skills, sharing feedback and ideas, and finding all the support you need for your GitHub projects. By participating in GitHub Community, you are agreeing to the same [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) that apply to GitHub.com, as well as this GitHub Community-specific Code of Conduct.

With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in GitHub Community, what you can expect from moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent suspension from community participation. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content within GitHub Community that we determine to be in violation of either the GitHub Terms of Service or this Code of Conduct.

Our diverse user base brings different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and ranges from people who created their first "Hello World" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our community has to offer, while maintaining a safe place for developers to do their best work.

[Pledge](#pledge)
-----------------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in GitHub Community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

[Standards](#standards)
-----------------------

Treat GitHub Community with respect. We are a shared resource — a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation.

The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

### [_Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community_](#best-practices-for-maintaining-a-strong-community)

The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.

*   Engage with consideration and respect.
    
    *   **Be welcoming and open-minded** - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
        
    *   **Be respectful** - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.
        
    *   **Be empathetic** - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.
        
*   Contribute in a positive and constructive way.
    
    *   **Improve the discussion.** Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.
        
        The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.
        
    *   **Be clear and stay on topic.** GitHub Community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.
        
        This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in GitHub Community discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.
        
    *   **Share mindfully.** When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.
        
        Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in GitHub Community, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to invite other GitHub users to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists. By sharing the link to your project repo - with some information on what your project is and what kind of help or feedback you're looking for - you can invite others to collaborate with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your private information. You can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project.
        
    *   **Keep it tidy.** Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:
        
        *   Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.
        *   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
        *   Don’t post no-content replies.
        *   Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
        *   Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.
        
        Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvote button. Rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.
        
*   Be trustworthy.
    
    *   **Always be honest.** Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community participants. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. GitHub staff will also be active in GitHub Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.

### [_What is not Allowed_](#what-is-not-allowed)

GitHub's [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), which are part of GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), set a baseline for what is not allowed on GitHub. Since GitHub Community is on GitHub.com, these terms and restrictions apply to GitHub Community, including the following restrictions:

*   **Anyone under the age of 13.** If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your GitHub.com account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) for information about account termination.
    
*   **Creating new account after account restriction.** GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) state that "One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account." Additional free accounts created to inquire about flagged or suspended accounts in GitHub will be removed.
    
*   **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.** GitHub Community is a professional space and should be treated as such.
    
*   **Violation of Terms of Service.** If your GitHub.com account is identified in violation of [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) we will have to close your account.
    

### [_Reasonable use of AI generated content_](#reasonable-use-of-ai-generated-content)

We love experimenting with new technologies, and we are especially fond of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). But as with all new technology, many of us are still getting accustomed to using generative AI tools the most effectively. Here are important guidelines to follow when using generative AI to answer questions in the community:

*   Take personal responsibility for everything you post.
*   Read and revise the content before you post it; use your own authentic voice.
*   Use your expertise as a developer to verify that the answer works and makes sense.
*   Do not just post AI-generated content verbatim to inflate your reputation or give a false impression of product expertise.
*   AI tools will often answer in an authoritative tone that sounds like a tech support professional. Be careful not to [mislead other users](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-impersonation) into thinking that this authoritative tone means they are receiving an official response from GitHub.

Additionally, all of the guidelines listed in the previous section ([Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct#best-practices-for-maintaining-a-strong-community)) also apply here.

The community is here for users to build trust through authentic reputations. Not adhering to these guidelines may, in some cases, constitute a Code of Conduct violation. Refer to [the enforcement section](#enforcement) below for more information.

[Enforcement](#enforcement)
---------------------------

*   **If you see a problem, report it.** Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this GitHub Community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
    
    When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. You can report a disruptive user or disruptive content to GitHub. For more information, see [Reporting abuse or spam](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam).
    

### [Our Responsibilities](#our-responsibilities)

There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble.

Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this Code of Conduct to guide our decision.

Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:

*   Content Removal
*   Content Blocking
*   GitHub Account Suspension
*   GitHub Account Termination

GitHub Community moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the GitHub Community's leadership.

If, for any reason, you want to contact GitHub Staff, the Community Managers, Administrators, or Moderators of GitHub Community privately, you can contact GitHub Support through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). Contacting any member of GitHub Staff via unsolicited mentions or pings, or via channels other than GitHub Community itself, or the Support contact form is strongly discouraged and may be considered a violation of our prohibition against harassment.

Let's work together to keep GitHub Community a place where people feel safe to participate by being respectful of them and their time.

[Legal Notices](#legal-notices)
-------------------------------

Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves – and by extension, you and your data – against unfriendly folks. We have a [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), which includes our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), and our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) and the [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

This Code of Conduct does not modify our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)—which includes our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)—and is not intended to be a complete list. GitHub retains full discretion under the [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) to remove or restrict any content or accounts for activity that violates those policies, including because it is unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or violates any party's intellectual property or our Terms of Service. This Code of Conduct describes when we will exercise that discretion.

### [Data Retention and Deletion of Data](#data-retention-and-deletion-of-data)

If you're a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) or contacting GitHub Support through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request. For more information please see the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-sponsors-additional-terms

Your participation in the GitHub Sponsors Program (the "Program") is subject to the [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) (the "Agreement") or other agreement you have with GitHub (for example the GitHub Customer General Terms, the GitHub Corporate Terms of Service or other agreement), as well as the following additional terms ("Additional Terms"). Any use of the GitHub Sponsors Program that violates the Agreement will also be a violation of these Additional Terms. Any capitalized terms used but not defined below have the meanings in the Agreement. These Additional Terms for the GitHub Sponsors Program describe the relationship between GitHub and you, the "Sponsored Developer", for the Program. The Additional Terms are effective as of the date you accept them ("Effective Date").

The purpose of this Agreement is to: 1) set forth the terms under which Sponsors will participate in the GitHub Sponsors Program (the "Program"); and 2) set forth the terms under which Sponsored Developers may participate in the Program. The Program allows sponsors to identify certain open source projects ("Projects") housed on GitHub and to make committed investments in those Projects to further the Projects' development.

[1\. Definitions.](#1-definitions)
----------------------------------

"**Confidential Information**" means all non-public information disclosed under this Agreement by either party to the other in any format, designated as confidential or that the receiving party knows or reasonably should know, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information, is confidential to the disclosing party.

"**GitHub Policies**" means all then-current policies and procedures of GitHub that Sponsored Developer must follow as noted in the Program, including the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

"**Sponsor**" means the User who purchased a Subscription from or paid a Sponsorship to you through your Sponsored Developer Account.

“**Sponsored Developer**” means the individual or entity that develops content under the Program and receives Sponsored Developer Payments while participating in the Program.

"**Sponsored Developer Account**" means the account that you establish through the Program to receive payment from Sponsors.

"**Sponsored Developer Content**" means all content you submit to GitHub in connection with the Program, including User-Generated Content and Your Content; your brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, or indicia of origin ("**Sponsored Developer Marks**"); and data associated with your Sponsored Developer Account.

"**Sponsorship**" means a payment paid to you through the Program and the Service.

"**Subscription**" means a recurring or one-time Sponsorship in exchange for goods, services, or other offers you provide to Sponsors.

"**Sponsored Developer Payment**" means the net of one hundred percent (100%) of GitHub's gross monthly payments received from Sponsorships and Subscriptions to Sponsored Developer Accounts, plus any applicable Matching Funds, and other proceeds from monetization options that the Sponsored Developer elects to use, as applicable, less any discounts, taxes, fees, amounts that GitHub did not collect or which were refunded or charged back, amounts owed to any third-party in connection with the Program with respect to a Sponsored Developer Account, and other Exclusions as outlined in Section 4.

"**USD**" means United States Dollar.

[1\. Acceptable Use.](#1-acceptable-use)
----------------------------------------

In order to participate in the Program, you must comply with your country's minimum age laws (for example, you must be at least 13 years of age if you live in the United States), have a valid GitHub account, and have agreed to the [Acceptable Use section](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#c-acceptable-use) in the Agreement and applicable GitHub Policies, and these GitHub Sponsors Additional Terms.

If you are over the age of 13 but are under 18, you can give and receive Sponsor funds, provided that Stripe, our payment processor, can collect verification information from your legal guardian.

You will not under any circumstances allow payments or raise funds involving:

*   Fraud, ransom, violations of intellectual property, or other illegal purposes;
    
*   Misrepresentation or deception related to the reasons you're raising funds or requesting sponsorship;
    
*   The purchase or sale of ICOs, utility tokens, or other types of cryptocurrency;
    
*   The purchase or sale of securities, equity, or other types of investment offers;
    
*   The sale of personal information, or the processing of personal information in violation of any laws;
    
*   Lotteries, raffles, gambling, pyramid schemes, self-dealing, "get rich quick schemes", deceptive marketing schemes, "donation for donation" schemes, or any attempts to game GitHub's or third parties' systems or services; and,
    
*   Activities with, in, or involving countries, regions, governments, persons, or entities that are not permitted under U.S. and other economic sanctions under applicable law.
    

The GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund aims to encourage the community that participates in the Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystem to contribute sustainable funding to qualifying individuals with Sponsored Developer Accounts. All individuals who applied to the Program before January 1, 2020, will be reviewed for eligibility for the Matching Fund, but not all eligible individual Sponsored Developer Accounts will receive matching. Organizations cannot participate in the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund, and Sponsorship from an organization to a qualifying Sponsored Developer Account will not be matched. See below for additional rules.

#### [1.2.1. Matching Fund Terms.](#121-matching-fund-terms)

Eligibility for the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and is subject to the following limitations:

*   You must have a GitHub account, be accepted into the Program as an individual, and be actively contributing to OSS. Please note, GitHub does not allow operating more than one free personal account. As such, matching is available on an individual basis and will not be approved across multiple accounts.
    
*   Your use of GitHub and your Sponsored Developer Account must be, based on our determination, in our sole discretion, in accordance with the GitHub Sponsors mission to expand the opportunities to contribute to open source that upholds the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).
    
*   You cannot receive matching for any sponsorship that originates from a user or organization account with a published GitHub Sponsors profile.
    
*   GitHub reserves the right to withhold or rescind Matching Fund money and block any user from participation in the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund for any reason, including but not limited to posting content or projects that GitHub determines are offensive or otherwise objectionable.
    

#### [1.2.2. Matching Period.](#122-matching-period)

The matching period begins after GitHub accepts an individual Sponsored Developer Account into GitHub Sponsors. For each individual Sponsored Developer Account eligible for the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund, GitHub can match community sponsorship up to $5,000 USD total during the Sponsored Developer Account's first 12 months in the Program. The matching period cannot be extended for any reason. During the matching period, GitHub will not charge any fees, so 100% of sponsorships will go to the sponsored developer. In the future, we may charge a nominal processing fee.

*   If a Sponsorship or Sponsoring Subscription stops for any reason, the associated matching will stop as well. Funds that are charged back to the Sponsor before the Sponsored Developer Payment date are not eligible for matching.
    
*   If you leave GitHub Sponsors and rejoin later, the gap between your participation periods may count toward your matching period or your matching period may expire.
    
*   If GitHub discovers a potential policy violation, prior to payment of any matching funds granted during the matching period, GitHub may disable payouts until an investigation has been completed, and matched funds contributed to the sponsored developer may be revoked if they are found to be in violation of this policy.
    
*   GitHub may contact GitHub Sponsors applicants or participants for additional information regarding their sponsorship profile or activity to determine eligibility for sponsorship or matching, or as part of investigating potential terms violations.
    

### [2.1. General.](#21-general)

You will: (A) create a Sponsored Developer Account; (B) make Sponsored Developer Content available via the Program and Service; and, (C) comply with all GitHub Policies. You will be solely responsible for support, development, and maintenance of your Sponsored Developer Account and Sponsored Developer Content, and any complaints about them.

### [2.2. Registration.](#22-registration)

If you choose to apply for the Program, entry into the Program is contingent upon your completion of the registration process and acceptance into the Program by GitHub. In addition, you may be required to register with the payment service provider(s) selected by GitHub (such as Stripe) in order to access and use certain features of the Program. You must register with your true identity, and you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as requested by the Program's registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), as well as any privacy statement provided by our payment processor. GitHub reserves the right to refuse acceptance into the Program.

### [2.3. Content Monetization.](#23-content-monetization)

Through the Program and Service, GitHub may provide you various options to monetize your Sponsored Developer Content. Some options may require you to update certain settings in your Sponsored Developer Account. In addition, the ways in which the Program supports each monetization option may vary. If you utilize one (or more) of these options by changing the applicable settings, then you agree to the terms that apply to that option. Some monetization options may require you to provide additional information to GitHub or its service providers, or to accept additional GitHub terms or third-party terms.

#### [2.3.1. Subscriptions.](#231-subscriptions)

The Program provides you with the capability to offer Subscriptions. If you choose to offer Subscriptions, then GitHub will pay you the Subscription Sponsorship as provided in Section 4. You are responsible for determining the nature, content, and capabilities of your Subscription offer, subject to these Additional Terms and applicable GitHub Policies.

The Program or Service may provide you with the ability to accept a donation or other type of direct Sponsorship from another User without a Subscription offer. However, because GitHub does not fulfill those types of Sponsorships, you must establish a merchant account with a third-party payment service provider (such as Stripe) and be subject to that service provider's merchant account terms, conditions, and privacy policies. Any amounts contributed to you, donation or otherwise, will be paid directly to your merchant account and not included in any Sponsored Developer Payments. You agree that you will not have any claim or remedy against GitHub relating to donations and any disputes relating to a donation are solely between you and the third-party payment service provider. You are responsible for compliance with any third-party payment service provider's agreements, policies, and laws or regulations that may apply. GitHub may elect to provide you with information or a report on the amount of donations made to you for your convenience.

#### [2.3.3. Advertising.](#233-advertising)

While we understand that you may want to promote your Sponsors by posting their names or logos in your account, the primary focus of your Sponsored Developer Content should not be advertising or promotional marketing. In addition, you may not enter into any advertising agreement to promote any product or brand if doing so would be prohibited by the [Agreement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) or GitHub's Community Guidelines. If you decide to host any advertising or promotional materials in your Sponsored Developer Content, you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Guidelines on Endorsements and Testimonials.

[3\. Financial Terms.](#3-financial-terms)
------------------------------------------

### [3.1. Payment.](#31-payment)

GitHub will pay you the Sponsored Developer Payment in accordance with this Section 3, so long as you meet the Sponsored Developer Obligations in Section 2 and are not in violation of these Additional Terms. If you fail to meet these obligations for any given month, we may at our sole discretion withhold the Sponsored Developer Payment for that month. If you fail to meet or maintain the Sponsored Developer Obligations for two (2) or more months during the Term (consecutively or non-consecutively), then GitHub may terminate these Additional Terms as provided in Section 5.

The following amounts are not included in Sponsored Developer Payments, or may be withheld by GitHub, as applicable.

You will bear all expenses you incur in connection with your performance under these Additional Terms. We will not reimburse or advance you for any expenses.

#### [3.2.2. Taxes.](#322-taxes)

GitHub intends to comply with all applicable tax information reporting and tax withholding laws that GitHub reasonably determines in its judgment apply to these payments. If taxes are required to be withheld on any amounts to be paid by GitHub to you or from amounts which are subject to tax information reporting under applicable laws, GitHub will deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority and, as required, will secure and deliver to you an official receipt for any such taxes withheld as required under applicable laws. GitHub will use reasonable efforts to minimize such taxes to the extent permissible under applicable law, and each party will reasonably cooperate with the other to obtain the lowest tax rates or elimination of such taxes pursuant to the applicable income tax laws or treaties. This includes you providing to GitHub adequate information required under applicable laws, such as IRS Forms W-8, W-9, or other information to establish exemptions from withholding. You will also be responsible for complying with any third-party payment processor’s terms and conditions regarding tax withholding and reporting, if applicable. Furthermore, GitHub reserves the right to suspend payments to your account until you provide GitHub with adequate documentation or information required under applicable laws for GitHub to determine any applicable tax withholding or reporting obligations that apply to the payments under these Additional Terms or Agreement.

In the event of a Sponsored Developer's breach, or suspected breach, of these Additional Terms or the Agreement, GitHub reserves the right to withhold payment to the Sponsored Developer under these Additional Terms or otherwise, pending GitHub's reasonable investigation of the same. If GitHub determines, in its sole discretion, that a Sponsored Developer is in breach of these Additional Terms or the Agreement, GitHub may permanently withhold any amounts due to the Sponsored Developer.

### [3.3. Payment Timing.](#33-payment-timing)

During the term, GitHub will remit to you all Sponsored Developer Payments received in a given month within 30 days after the close of that month, subject to the variables below. Payouts are sent through Stripe Connect, ACH transfer, or wire transfer to the bank account you provided when you applied for GitHub Sponsors. We are not responsible for delay or misapplication of any Sponsored Developer Payment because of incorrect or incomplete information supplied by you or a bank, or for failure of a bank to credit your account.

*   For first payments, GitHub will remit to you all Sponsored Developer Payments 60 days after the first sponsorship is initiated, subject to the variables below. This probation period is applied to all Sponsored Developer Accounts and helps ensure the integrity of the program. Payments thereafter will be remitted within 30 days of the close of that month, in accordance with this section.
    
*   If you are paid through Stripe Connect, you will receive payouts on the 22nd of the month for the balance accrued since the last payout, regardless of the amount of the balance. Payout initiation dates vary by country, and can change from month to month due to public holidays, weekends, and other factors. When the payout is a cross-border payout, a minimum payout amount may apply. For more information, see [Receiving payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#cbp-minimum-payout-amounts) in the Stripe documentation.
    
*   If you are paid through ACH transfer or wire transfer, you will receive payouts on the third Thursday of the month. GitHub will issue a payout to you for any month that your balance reaches $100 USD. Contributions from the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund do not count towards this threshold. If your balance is below $100 at the end of the month, the balance will accrue until the next time your balance is above the threshold at the end of the month. If you leave GitHub Sponsors, GitHub will issue a payout for your remaining balance even if the balance is below $100.
    
*   After termination, we will remit to you all Sponsored Developer Payments received and unpaid within approximately 90 days after the end of the calendar month in which we recognize that these Additional Terms have been terminated.
    

### [3.4. Payment Method.](#34-payment-method)

We will remit Sponsored Developer Payments by ACH/SEPA or wire to an account that you specify subject to the thresholds, methods and timeframes provided in our then-current payment policies, which we may update from time to time. The payment method and threshold may vary depending on the country and account information you provide. We may, at our sole discretion, combine the Sponsored Developer Payment with any other payments that may be owed to you.

### [3.5. Currency.](#35-currency)

All references to currency are to USD. If you are outside of the United States, we may convert USD to the local currency of your address for payment, using our then-current conversion rates.

### [3.6. Refund Requirements.](#36-refund-requirements)

You will be responsible for specifying the terms and conditions regarding any refunds, if any, to your Sponsors. In no event shall GitHub be responsible for providing any support for refunds, nor shall GitHub be liable for payment of any refund.

### [3.7. Requested Payment Information.](#37-requested-payment-information)

To pay you, you must provide us with complete and accurate financial, tax, and banking information that we request (for example, by means of account creation or setup, or otherwise). We will notify you, by any means of communication, of changes to what information is required. If you fail to accurately provide (or accurately maintain) such information, (a) we can deduct from your Sponsored Developer Payment any related bank fees, and (b) we can terminate these Additional Terms and you may forfeit any amounts owed to you by GitHub.

### [3.8. Stripe Connect](#38-stripe-connect)

If you are paid through Stripe Connect, the following additional terms apply to your usage of GitHub Sponsors:

By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Sponsored Developer Account on GitHub Sponsors, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of GitHub enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide GitHub accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize GitHub to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

**Recipient service agreement**

_Applies to Sponsored Developer Accounts in all other countries._

We use Stripe to make payouts to Sponsored Developer Accounts. The [Stripe Recipient Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient) applies to your receipt of such payouts. To receive payouts from GitHub Sponsors, you must provide us accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize us to share it and transaction information related to your payout with Stripe.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-registered-developer-agreement

GitHub is fortunate to have many developers integrating with our platform. We think that’s awesome, and we want to make that experience even better. GitHub’s Developer Program (the “Program”) helps us to connect with you, share information with you, and support your creative efforts better than ever before. The special relationship between GitHub and the developer community that the Program creates requires a special set of terms. Welcome to the Registered Developer Agreement (“Agreement”).

This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (“you”) and GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”, or “us”). Be sure to read this Agreement carefully - it governs your participation in the Program, and we’re only willing to let you participate in the Program if you accept all the terms of this Agreement. By clicking “I Agree” below, or by participating in the Program in any way – for example, by accessing information about GitHub products or features that aren’t yet available to the general public – you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement. IF YOU’RE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE "YOU" WILL MEAN THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DON’T HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST SELECT THE "CANCEL" BUTTON AND YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IF YOU’RE A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT THE PERSON CLICKING “I AGREE” HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND YOU TO THIS AGREEMENT.

1.  **GitHub.com’s Terms of Use Will Apply**
    
    You need to have an account on GitHub.com in order to participate in the Program. By clicking “I Agree” at the bottom of this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the GitHub.com [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) (the “TOS”). In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and the TOS, this Agreement will control; otherwise, both agreements will apply to you concurrently.
    
2.  **Program Terms**
    
    We post the [Program’s benefits and guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-integrations/github-developer-program) (the “Program Overview”). As you might expect, the Program Overview will change from time to time. These changes will apply to you as a participant in the Program, so we encourage you to periodically review the Program Overview to keep apprised of any changes. For a variety of reasons, we might need to change, suspend, or discontinue the Program, or some of the benefits we offer. You agree that we can do those things without liability to you, except as specified in Section 9.
    
3.  **API License**
    
    So long as you remain compliant with the TOS, this Agreement, and the Program Terms, we grant You a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during the term of this Agreement to access and use our API (as defined in the [TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)) solely for the purpose of developing, demonstrating, testing and supporting interoperability and integrations between your products and services and our products and services.
    
    You promise not to do bad things with our API. Among other things, this means you won’t – and won’t allow or permit others to – modify, publish, sell, lease, license, distribute, or sublicense our API; decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from our API; reproduce, modify or create derivative works from our API; use our API to provide service bureau, application hosting, or processing services to third parties; incorporate or otherwise combine or integrate our API with any of your products or services; or use our API to engage in, support, or enable any kind of illegal activity.
    
    We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part of it) with or without notice. It’s your sole responsibility to ensure that your use of the API is compatible with the then-current API. Other than the rights we expressly give you in this Agreement or the TOS, We don’t grant you any rights or licenses to our API, or to any other GitHub products or services.
    
4.  **Account Authorization Services**
    
    As part of the Program, GitHub may offer Account Authorization Services, such as [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps), for the primary purpose of creating applications that can integrate with the GitHub platform. Such Account Authorization Services are not intended to be used as the sole identity provider for your application or service. GitHub reserves the right to suspend access to any application using its Account Authorization Services that: (i) is consuming a disproportionate amount of resources compared to other applications (for example, if your application is inducing users to create multiple or “throw-away” GitHub accounts); (ii) would be in violation of [GitHub’s Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) if the application was hosted on our platform; (iii) facilitates or incentivizes any spammy or inauthentic activity on GitHub (for example, promising rewards for account creation); (iv) presents itself or its login page in a manner that suggests sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with GitHub; or (v) misrepresents or obscures what it does (for example, if an application takes any actions, like starring repositories, on behalf of a user without this action being explicitly disclosed).
    
5.  **Your Products, Services, and Integrations**
    
    Your products, services, and integrations (collectively, your “Products”) are your responsibility. That means that you’re solely responsible for developing, operating, and maintaining all aspects of your Products; ensuring that all materials used with or in your Products are legal in all the jurisdictions where your Products are used, and don’t promote illegal activities; obtaining any rights or licenses necessary to use and/or distribute any third-party software that you use, include, integrate, or distribute with your Products; and providing your end user customers with the same high-quality technical support for your Products when they operate in conjunction with our API or any other of our products and services as you do when they operate on their own.
    
6.  **Marketing and Publicity**
    
    Marketing and publicizing your integrations with GitHub is valuable to both of us. We want to be sure that happens in the right way, so we’ve included some language here to help clarify some basic “dos” and “don’ts”.
    
    You agree that you won’t make any representations, warranties, guarantees or endorsements to anyone on behalf of GitHub (including, among other things, any GitHub products or services). Unless we specifically say it’s okay in the Program Terms, you promise not to state or imply that we have developed, endorsed, reviewed or otherwise approved of any of your Products.
    
    If you decide to promote or publicize any of our products or services in connection with your Products, you’ll need to make sure that you abide by the terms of this Agreement, the Program Terms, the TOS, our [trademark policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy), and any other applicable GitHub policies. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TOS, and during the term of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the “GitHub Marks”) in accordance with our [trademark policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy) and as specified in the Program Terms, solely for the purpose of publicizing your membership in the Program.
    
    We want to tell the world about you, and your participation in the Program. To help us do that, you grant us a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the “Partner Marks”) in our marketing materials, solely for the purpose of promoting the Program and publicizing your participation in it.
    
    Except as set forth in this Agreement and the TOS, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to grant to one party any right, title or interest in or to the other party’s Marks. You agree not to, whether during or after the term of this Agreement: (i) challenge or assist others in challenging the GitHub Marks, or our registration or enforcement of the GitHub Marks; (ii) attempt to adopt, use, apply for, or register any trademark, service mark, logo, URL, Internet domain name, or symbol that is confusingly similar to the GitHub Marks; or (iii) make any negative, false, or disparaging statements (whether written or oral) to any third-party about us, our products, or our services.
    
7.  **Confidentiality; Pre-Release Materials**
    
    As a registered developer in the Program, you may get access to special information not available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.
    
    You agree that any non-public information we give you, or that you may have access to as part of the Program, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for your authorized purposes as a participant in the Program (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should take reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third-party other than your employees and contractors, and then only to the extent that: (i) they need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; (ii) you make them aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (iii) you remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such employees and contractors; and (iv) we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure.
    
    You understand that unauthorized disclosure or use of our Confidential Information could cause us irreparable harm, and significant injury that may be difficult for us to quantify. Accordingly, you agree that we’ll have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to make sure you comply with this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have. If you are required by law, regulation or a valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose our Confidential Information, you may do so, but only if you notify us before you do, and do your best to limit such disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information.
    
    The obligations in this Section 7 won’t apply to information that you can prove: (i) was generally available to the public before we disclosed it to you; (ii) became generally available to the public after we disclosed it to you, through no action or inaction on your part, or on the part of your employees or contractors; (iii) you knew about before we disclosed it to you; (iv) was disclosed to you by a third-party, who didn’t have any confidentiality obligations with respect to it; (v) you independently developed without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third-party; or (vi) we gave you permission to disclose, in a writing signed by one of our authorized representatives.
    
    If We give you any pre-release software or related documentation or materials, which may include videos or other forms of content (“Pre-release Materials”), then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TOS, we hereby grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable right and license to use the Pre-release Materials solely to support your testing and/or development of products or services that are designed to operate in combination with the systems or programs for which the Pre-release Materials are designed. If the Pre-release Materials are accompanied by a separate license agreement, you agree that the separate license agreement (in addition to any more restrictive provisions contained in this Agreement or the TOS) will apply. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Pre-release Materials to a human-perceivable form, and you promise not to modify, network, rent, lease, transmit, sell, or loan the Pre-release Materials, in whole or in part. You understand that we’re under no obligation to provide any Pre-release Materials to you, to provide you with updates, enhancements, or corrections to the Pre-release Materials, or to notify you of changes that we make to our products and services, now or in the future.
    
8.  **Fees and Payment**
    
    There may be fees associated with participating in the Program. We’ll tell you what those fees are in the Program Terms, as we update them from time to time (the “Program Fees”). If you gave us your payment information before, you agree that we can charge the same credit card or PayPal account as part of this Agreement. Otherwise, you’ll need to give us a valid payment account, and other supporting information. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 9, any payments you make to us for the Program are non-refundable. You give us permission to automatically charge your payment account on the anniversary of your first payment date to cover all of the coming year’s Program Fees, unless you terminate this Agreement first according to Section 1. All fees are due in U.S. Dollars, and are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities (you’re responsible for all of those, except for taxes based on our income).
    
9.  **Term and Termination**
    
    This Agreement begins on the date you click “Agree”, and continues for a period of one (1) year. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party gives written notice at least thirty (30) days before the current term expires that it wants to terminate, or one of us terminates it earlier in accordance with this Section 9.
    
    Either you or GitHub may terminate this Agreement for any reason, without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other. If we terminate this Agreement or discontinue your access to the Program for any reason other than your breach of this Agreement, the Program Terms, or the TOS, we will, as your sole remedy and our sole obligation for such termination, refund you the pro rata portion of the Program Fees you paid us for the current term of this Agreement. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without the requirement of notice, if you breach any term of this Agreement, the Program Terms, or the TOS.
    
    The rights and obligations in Sections 1, 2, 3 (second and third paragraphs), 4, 5, 6 (second and last paragraphs), 7, 8, and 10 through 22 of this Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement all of the rights and licenses we granted you in this Agreement will immediately cease to exist, you will return (or, at our request, destroy) all of our Confidential Information and any copies (including electronic copies) which are in your possession or control, and you will certify in writing that you’ve complied with these requirements.
    
10.  **Warranties and Disclaimers**
    
    You warrant to us that you: (i) have the authority to execute this Agreement and to perform its obligations; (ii) will conduct business in a manner that reflects favorably at all times on GitHub’s products and services and our good name, goodwill and reputation; (iii) will make no false or misleading statements or representations regarding GitHub or our products and services; (iv) will not take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representation, warranty, guarantee or endorsement to anyone on our behalf (including, without limitation, any of our products or services); and (v) will not state or imply that We have developed, endorsed, reviewed or otherwise approved of any of your Products.
    
    THE PROGRAM, THE API AND ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WE GIVE YOU (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU WILL MEET YOUR OR YOUR END USERS’ REQUIREMENTS.
    
11.  **Indemnity**
    
    We’re giving you lots of useful pre-release stuff as part of the Program, and there are ways that you could use that stuff improperly that could cause us harm. With that in mind, and since we can’t control the ways that you participate in the Program, you agree that you will indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims which may arise under or out of your participation in the Program; your use of the API, our Confidential Information, or any other GitHub products and services; your negligence or intentional misconduct; your Products, or any integrations you develop, design, promote or distribute using our API or any Confidential Information; any misrepresentations you make with respect to us, or our products or services; or your violation of any part of this Agreement.
    
12.  **Limitation of Liability**
    
    IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRODUCTS LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
    
13.  **Export Control**
    
    You aren’t allowed to export or re-export any of our Confidential Information, except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Confidential Information was obtained.

14.  **Proprietary Rights**
    
    You agree that GitHub and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the API, the Pre-release Materials, and all other GitHub products and services; all information and data relating to their configurations and combinations; and all modifications to and derivative works of any of the foregoing.

17.  **Feedback**
    
    We’re always trying to improve, and your feedback will help us do that.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-marketplace-terms-of-service

Welcome to GitHub Marketplace ("Marketplace")! We're happy you're here. Please read these Terms of Service ("Marketplace Terms") carefully before accessing or using GitHub Marketplace. GitHub Marketplace is a platform that allows you to select developer apps or actions (for free or for a charge) that can be used with your GitHub.com account ("Developer Products"). Although offered by GitHub, Inc. ("GitHub", "we", "us"), Developer Products may be developed and maintained by either GitHub or by third-party software providers. Your selection or use of Developer Products is subject to these Marketplace Terms and any applicable fees, and may require you to agree to additional terms as provided by the third party licensor of that Developer Product (the "Product Provider"). Your use of GitHub Models is subject to the [GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

By using Marketplace, you are agreeing to be bound by these Marketplace Terms.

Effective Date: August 1, 2024

[A. GitHub.com's Terms of Service](#a-githubcoms-terms-of-service)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketplace is provided by GitHub, and is governed by these Marketplace Terms combined with your main agreement with us — the [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the [GitHub Corporate Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-corporate-terms-of-service) or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. If you configure the Developer Products to work with one or more accounts on the GitHub.com website, your use of the Developer Products will also be governed by your applicable GitHub Terms. Any capitalized terms not defined in this document will be defined in your applicable GitHub Terms.

You may not use a Developer Product to violate your applicable GitHub Terms. Many of these Developer Products are used exclusively for performing automated tasks. In addition, multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your account, or you are an owner of an account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through your account.

[B. Use Requirements](#b-use-requirements)
------------------------------------------

In order to use Marketplace, you must be 13 years of age or older (if you live in the United States; if you live in another country, you must comply with your country's minimum age laws), have a valid GitHub account, and have agreed to your applicable GitHub Terms and these Marketplace Terms.

If you are agreeing to these Marketplace Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Marketplace on its behalf to these Marketplace Terms. If you do not have authority, you must not accept these Marketplace Terms and you may not use the Marketplace services.

[C. Developer Products and Product Providers](#c-developer-products-and-product-providers)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you install and/or purchase a Developer Product, then you are purchasing the Developer Products from GitHub and you are required to make the related payments directly to GitHub. However, you are receiving access to and the rights to use that Developer Product from a Product Provider, not from GitHub (unless it's a GitHub-owned Developer Product). The Product Provider is solely responsible for the Developer Product it provides, the content therein, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Developer Product or your use of that Developer Product.

We are not a party to the agreement between you and the Product Provider with respect to that Developer Product. We are not responsible for that Developer Product, the content in it, or any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Developer Product or your use of that Developer Product. However, we are a third party beneficiary of the agreement between you and the Product Provider for each Developer Product, and we will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce that agreement against you as a third party beneficiary.

[D. Payment, Billing Schedule, and Cancellation](#d-payment-billing-schedule-and-cancellation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All payments for Developer Products will go through GitHub. The terms of your payment and fees will be governed by [Section K. Payment](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#k-payment), or the analogous section of your applicable GitHub Terms. By using the Marketplace, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your purchase of the Developer Product. Each purchase is an electronic contract between you and GitHub, and you and the Product Provider. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for purchases of Developer Products. If you are only purchasing free Developer Products, you are not required to provide payment information.

**Billing Schedule; No Refunds.** Your payment schedule is determined by the payment schedule you chose when you created your GitHub account (e.g. free, monthly, annual). For monthly or yearly payment plans, Marketplace purchases are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. If you would like to cancel the Developer Product services, you can do so by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen.

If you would have a question, concern, or dispute regarding your billing, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/).

[E. Your Data and GitHub's Privacy Policy](#e-your-data-and-githubs-privacy-policy)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Privacy.** When you select or use a Developer Product, GitHub may share certain Personal Information (as defined in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)) with the Product Provider (if any such Personal Information is received from you) in order to provide you with the Developer Product, regardless of your privacy settings. Depending on the requirements of the Developer Product you choose, GitHub may share as little as your account name, ID, and primary email address or as much as access to the content in your repositories, including the ability to read and modify your private data. You will be able to view the scope of the permissions the Developer Product is requesting, and accept or deny them, when you grant it authorization via OAuth.

If you cease using the Developer Product and revoke access through your account settings, the Product Provider will no longer be able to access your account. The Product Provider is responsible for deleting your Personal Information from its systems within its defined window. Please contact the Product Provider to ensure that your account has been properly terminated.

**Data Security and Privacy Disclaimer.** When you select or use a Developer Product, the security of the Developer Product and the custodianship of your data, including your Personal Information (if any), is the responsibility of the Product Provider. You are responsible for understanding the security and privacy considerations of the selection or use of the Developer Product for your own security and privacy risk and compliance considerations.

[F. Rights to Developer Products](#f-rights-to-developer-products)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The rights granted to you to use any Developer Product are personal to you, and are not transferrable to any third parties, such as your end users. Any rights to provide or resell Developer Products to third parties must be granted directly by the Product Provider.

[G. Updates to Developer Products](#g-updates-to-developer-products)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, GitHub.com may check with remote servers (hosted by GitHub or by third parties) for available updates to Developer Products, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. You agree that such updates will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.

[H. Developer Product Blocking](#h-developer-product-blocking)
--------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub may block a Developer Product from our servers, or disable its functionality, for legal or policy reasons. In the event that we must block or disable a Developer Product, we will work with the Product Provider to notify affected users.

[I. Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability; Release and Indemnification](#i-disclaimer-limitation-of-liability-release-and-indemnification)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Disclaimer.** Your use of Marketplace and any Developer Products obtained through Marketplace is at your sole risk. Other than as expressly stated, GitHub provides Marketplace and Developer Products “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” GitHub does not make or imply any warranties or commitments about Marketplace and Developer Products, including but not limited to the specific functionality available through Marketplace and Developer Products, their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your need.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, Marketplace (or any part of it) with or without notice.

**Limitation of Liability.** You understand and agree that GitHub will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from: (i) your use or inability to use Marketplace or any Developer Products; (ii) any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of Marketplace or Developer Products; (iii) Marketplace generally or the software or systems that make Marketplace available; (iv) unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; (v) statements or conduct of any third party, Product Provider, or Developer Product on Marketplace; (vi) any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of Marketplace; or (vii) any other matter relating to Marketplace.

**Release and Indemnification.** If you have a dispute with one or more Product Providers, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of Marketplace, including but not limited to your violation of these Marketplace Terms, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[J. Miscellanea](#j-miscellanea)
--------------------------------

1.  **Governing Law.** You agree that these Marketplace Terms and your use of the Developer Products are governed under California law and any dispute related to the Developer Products must be brought in a tribunal of competent jurisdiction located in or near San Francisco, California.
    
2.  **Non-Assignability.** GitHub may assign or delegate these Marketplace Terms and/or the [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Marketplace Terms or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.
    
3.  **Severability, No Waiver, and Survival.** If any part of these Marketplace Terms are held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Marketplace Terms will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. The failure of GitHub to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Marketplace Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Our rights under these Marketplace Terms will survive any termination of these Marketplace Terms.
    
4.  **No Modifications; Complete Agreement.** These Marketplace Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version. These Marketplace Terms, together with [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us. These Marketplace Terms supersede any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms.
    
5.  **Section Headings.** Throughout these Marketplace Terms, each section includes titles of the following terms and conditions. These section titles are not legally binding.

[4\. TAKEDOWNS](#4takedowns)
----------------------------

**4.1** Your Takedowns. Upon providing GitHub with thirty (30) days written notice, you may remove your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace. You must continue to comply with this Agreement for any Listing already distributed through Marketplace including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace does not (a) affect the license rights of End Users who have previously purchased or installed your Listing or (b) change your obligation to deliver or support Listing that has been previously purchased or installed by users. If you remove your Listing, GitHub will not disclose your reason for the removal.

**4.2** GitHub Review and Takedowns. GitHub may review or test your Listing for compliance with this Agreement, GitHub ToS, and any other applicable terms, obligations, laws, or regulations. GitHub retains sole and absolute discretion over what Listings are included on Marketplace. You may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for Marketplace, or as part of your continued use of Marketplace. You agree that any information you give to Marketplace will be accurate, correct and up to date. As part of the specification for your Listing, GitHub may ask that you include in the file for your Listing information such as your name and email address. GitHub may use this information when featuring the Listing in our directory or for other uses.

If GitHub is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware and determines, in its sole discretion, that a Listing or any portion thereof or your Brand Features:

*   (i) violates the terms of this Agreement or the ToS;
*   (ii) the display of the Listing is impacting the integrity of GitHub servers (i.e., users are unable to access such content or otherwise experience difficulty);
*   (iii) is deemed by GitHub to add undue risk to Marketplace End Users’ data or impair the user experience of Marketplace or GitHub; or
*   (iv) is subject to End User complaints in regards to your breach of your EULA,

GitHub may: suspend the transfer of Personal Data to your Developer Product; prohibit the collection and processing of Personal Data via your Developer Product; remove the Listing from Marketplace; flag, filter, or modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata); or reclassify the Listing at its sole discretion. If GitHub takes any of these actions on your Listing, you may appeal GitHub's action through the [GitHub Appeal and Reinstatement Process](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement)

**4.3** Developer Product Updates. From time to time, GitHub may check for available updates to any Listing, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. If you update your Listing to Marketplace, you agree that such update will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you. GitHub makes no guarantees regarding the timing of such updates. Updates to a Listing are subject to the same terms and conditions as the Listing.

**4.4** End-User Takedowns. If an End-User uses your Developer Product in a way that violates the Terms, then we have the right to suspend or terminate that End-User's access to the Developer Product without any liability to you.

[5\. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS](#5representations-warranties-and-covenants)

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-research-program-terms

Welcome to the GitHub Research Program (the "Program")! To participate, we’ll need you to agree to a special set of terms, the GitHub Research Program Agreement (“Agreement”).

This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (“you”, "your") and GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”, or “us”). Be sure to read this Agreement carefully – you can only be a Program participant if you accept all the terms of this Agreement. By participating in the Program in any way – for example, by accessing information about GitHub products or services that aren’t yet available to the general public – you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement.

[A. Your Feedback](#a-your-feedback)
------------------------------------

We’re always trying to improve our products and services, and your feedback as a Program participant will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services through the Program (collectively, “Feedback”), then we need the legal rights to use and analyze that information for those purposes. In legalese, that means you grant GitHub a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[B. Confidentiality](#b-confidentiality)
----------------------------------------

GitHub may provide you with access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world for the purpose of providing feedback to us through the Program (the "Purpose"). Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

You agree that any non-public information we share with you or that you may have access to as a Program participant will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the Purpose stated above, and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your confidential information but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party.

You understand that unauthorized disclosure or use of our Confidential Information could cause us irreparable harm, and significant injury that may be difficult for us to quantify. Accordingly, you agree that we’ll have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to make sure you comply with this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have. If you are required by law, regulation or a valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose our Confidential Information, you may do so, but only if you notify us before you do, and do your best to limit such disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information.

The obligations in this Section 2 won’t apply to information that you can prove: (i) was generally available to the public before we disclosed it to you; (ii) became generally available to the public after we disclosed it to you, through no action or inaction on your part, or on the part of your employees or contractors; (iii) you knew about before we disclosed it to you; (iv) was disclosed to you by a third party, who didn’t have any confidentiality obligations with respect to it; (v) you independently developed without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (vi) we gave you permission to disclose, in a writing signed by one of our authorized representatives.

[C. Reservation of Rights](#c-reservation-of-rights)
----------------------------------------------------

All Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of GitHub. Neither party acquires any intellectual property rights under this Agreement, unless expressly specified herein.

[D. Privacy](#d-privacy)
------------------------

By participating in this Program, you consent to our use of your personal information for research purposes, and not for any other purposes. As part of the Program, we may use your personal information to contact you, or retain your information, to contact you at a later date. Personal information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated or other non-personally identifying information collected through the program to operate, analyze, and improve our products and services.

You can withdraw your consent at any time, and request access to or the deletion of the personal information that we hold about you. For more information about how you can access, update, alter, or delete the personal information GitHub collects through the Program, please see the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) or contact us through our [Privacy contact form](https://github.com/contact/privacy).

[E. GitHub Services and Software Terms](#e-github-services-and-software-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If access to GitHub's services or software are required to participate in certain Program studies or activities, then the applicable services or software agreement will apply to your use of those products (the "Generally Applicable Terms"). In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and the Generally Applicable Terms, your Generally Applicable Terms will control, except with respect to any use of Confidential Information (as defined below), in which case this Agreement will control.

[F. Disclaimer of Warranties](#f-disclaimer-of-warranties)
----------------------------------------------------------

All Confidential Information and other materials you receive through the Program are provided “as is” and without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Program including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

[G. Limitation of Liability](#g-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

Except as prohibited by law, you understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

[H. Miscellaneous](#h-miscellaneous)
------------------------------------

### [1\. Governing Law](#1-governing-law)

Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

### [3\. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival](#3-severability-no-waiver-and-survival)

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.

Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

### [4\. Amendments; Complete Agreement](#4-amendments-complete-agreement)

This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub.

Although we try to create a safe environment at the Event, we cannot guarantee 100% safety for participants. Please do your part to help reduce your chance of being injured at the Event.

You agree to carefully consider the risks inherent in any activities you choose to take part in at the Event and to take reasonable precautions before you choose to attend or participate at the Event.

You agree that you will not represent yourself as an employee, representative, or agent of GitHub (unless, of course, you are actually employed by GitHub).

We reserve the right to cancel the Event or any related event at any time, for any reason, and without liability or prejudice.

Any failure by GitHub to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Event Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

The views expressed by any event attendee, speaker, exhibitor, or sponsor are not necessarily those of GitHub. All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, and sponsors are solely responsible for the content of all presentations and any other material used at the Event.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-copilot-extension-developer-policy

> Last Updated: September 6, 2024

This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (“You”) and GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”, or “us”). By clicking “I Agree”, you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case “You” will mean the entity you represent.

GitHub is fortunate to have many developers integrating with the GitHub Copilot Extensibility Platform (“Platform”). We think that’s awesome, and we want to make that experience even better. While we can’t cover every type of GitHub Copilot Extension (“Extension”), we do want to lay some ground rules and policies to ensure that You are developing Your Extension with privacy, safety, transparency, and security at the forefront of the User experience.

To protect Users, we reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary if an Extension violates the letter or spirit of this Agreement. By “User” we mean any “User” as defined in our Terms of Service (TOS). By “Personal Data” we means any information which relates to an individual “User”, customer or employee which could, alone or together with other information, identify them as well as content, including, but not limited to, code, text, data uploaded, posted, User inputs, and Extension outputs, transmitted or otherwise made available by Users via the Platform.

[1\. Services](#1-services)
---------------------------

By using our Platform, you agree to adhere to this policy and all GitHub terms and policies incorporated by reference. You must also adhere to all technical specifications and requirements published by GitHub. GitHub may update this Agreement and any requirements at any time, and you should periodically review this Agreement and all technical specifications and requirements to ensure compliance with the most recent version. So long as you remain compliant with this Agreement and associated requirements within, we grant you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during the term of the Agreement to access and use the Platform for the purpose of publishing, developing, demonstrating, testing and supporting interoperability and integrations between Your Extension and GitHub Copilot.

GitHub reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, Your access to the Platform (or any part of it) with or without notice. It’s your sole responsibility to ensure that your use of the Platform is compatible with the then-current Platform. Other than the rights we expressly give you in this Agreement or the TOS, We don’t grant you any rights or licenses to GitHub Copilot, or to any other GitHub products or services.

Violations of this Agreement may result in removing the Extension from the Platform, token revocation, Account or Extension suspension, User notification, legal action or any other action deemed necessary by Us. If requested, You must provide us with proof of compliance with this Agreement. If You violate this Agreement we may or may not provide notice before taking action. Appeals may be submitted via the GitHub Appeal and Reinstatement Process. Please note that we may periodically audit Extensions and collect information about Users using Your Extension.

[2\. Developing your Extension](#2-developing-your-extension)
-------------------------------------------------------------

While we want You to develop useful, fun, and interesting Extensions with GitHub Copilot, we want to make sure that our Users receive a safe, secure, productive, and enjoyable experience. When creating Extensions, you must understand the use cases and limitations of GitHub Copilot, and not rely on it for tasks where its use could lead to significant harm. With that in mind, You are required to comply with this Policy and other obligations.

**Terms of Service:** Your Extension must comply with the GitHub Terms of Service (ToS) including the Acceptable Use Policy.

**Security:** We take the security of Personal Data seriously and you must as well. As you develop your Extension, You must properly configure your systems to protect Personal Data and ensure that any stored Personal Data is encrypted. Furthermore, Extensions and developers must not:

*   Degrade or compromise security
*   Bypass or circumvent protocols and access controls
*   Use unpublished APIs
*   Mislead and/or deceive Users about Extension functionality, performance, origin or Personal Data use
*   Transmit any viruses or other code that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system or Personal Data
*   Attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise derive source code, trade secrets, or know-how of the Platform or any portion thereof

**Use of Personal Data:** Protecting User privacy is paramount at GitHub, and must be for you. You are responsible for good Personal Data practices. You do not have independent rights to any Personal Data. In accordance with this, Extensions and developers are prohibited from:

*   Collecting, storing, and using Personal Data without obtaining proper User consent
*   Utilizing Personal Data to contact Users. You must gain permission through a clear and separate permissions process to contact Users outside of GitHub. Contacting Users is limited to emergencies in which the User’s safety and security is at risk and in compliance with the law
*   Requesting Users to provide sensitive, private, and confidential information, such as credit card numbers or passwords except when specifically necessary for the legitimate purpose of the Extension
*   Renting, selling or sharing Personal Data with third parties under any circumstances
*   Developing Extensions that encourage Users to circumvent or interfere with their own workplace and employer data, privacy and security policies
*   Using Personal Data to create User profiles beyond what is necessary for the Extension to function
*   Ignoring a User’s request for deletion. When a User deletes your Extension, if you discontinue Your Extension, or Your Extension is removed you must delete all associated Personal Data within thirty days
*   Merging Personal Data with data gathered from other sources for purposes unrelated to the use of the Extension including building databases or otherwise creating copies of any Personal Data accessed or obtained using the Platform
*   Failing to notify Users about privacy and their Personal Data. You must provide Users an easily accessible and publicly-available privacy policy that explains how the Extension collects, uses, processes and stores Personal Data, and what control Users have over their Personal Data
*   Accessing Data for surveillance purposes. You may not allow or assist any entity to conduct surveillance or obtain Personal Data using your access to the Platform
*   Otherwise exploiting Personal Data in a way not approved by GitHub and not disclosed to and permitted by Users. You may, however, use Data that is both aggregated and anonymized for purposes of analytics and development related to the Extension

**Law and Safety:** Extensions should not create unsafe environments or hardships for Users. Each Extension must comply with all applicable laws and legal requirements in all locations where it is made available to Users. In addition, Extensions and developers are prohibited from:

*   Inferring people’s emotional states from their physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics
*   Inferring people’s sensitive attributes such as gender, race, nationality, religion, or specific age (not including age range, position of mouth (e.g., smile or frown), and hair color)
*   Categorizing people based on their biometric data or to infer characteristics or affiliations about them such as race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, or sex life or sexual orientation
*   Social scoring or predictive profiling that would lead to discriminatory, unfair, biased, detrimental, unfavorable, or harmful treatment of certain persons or groups of persons
*   Exploiting any of the vulnerabilities of a person (e.g., age, disability, or socio-economic situation)
*   For any real-time facial recognition technology on mobile cameras used by any law enforcement globally to attempt to identify individuals in uncontrolled, "in the wild" environments, which includes (without limitation) police officers on patrol using body-worn or dash-mounted cameras using facial recognition technology to attempt to identify individuals present in a database of suspects or prior inmates
*   Without the individual’s valid consent, for ongoing surveillance or real-time or near real-time identification or persistent tracking of the individual using any of their personal information, including biometric data

**Transparency:** GitHub Copilot is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool intended to increase developer productivity. You must inform Users of Your Extensions intended use cases, best practices, and limitations as well as when they are interacting with generative AI content. Furthermore, Extensions and developers must:

*   Test the Extension to ensure outputs do not violate this Agreement
*   Provide a mechanism for Users to report feedback to You and GitHub related to errors, bugs, improper, or undesired outputs
*   Inform Users of Extension capabilities so that Users can provide the appropriate level of human oversight
*   Request only the appropriate and necessary permissions and clearly define the need for permissions within your Extension’s description

[3\. Your GitHub Copilot Extension](#3-your-github-copilot-extension)

If you decide to post any promotional materials in your Account, you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Guidelines on Endorsements and Testimonials. We reserve the right to remove any promotional materials or advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.

You must not engage in activity that significantly harms other users.

We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-active-malware-or-exploits

Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform in direct support of unlawful attacks that cause technical harms, such as using GitHub as a means to deliver malicious executables or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers. Technical harms means overconsumption of resources, physical damage, downtime, denial of service, or data loss, with no implicit or explicit dual-use purpose prior to the abuse occurring.

Note that GitHub allows dual-use content and supports the posting of content that is used for research into vulnerabilities, malware, or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such content has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community. We assume positive intention and use of these projects to promote and drive improvements across the ecosystem.

In rare cases of very widespread abuse of dual-use content, we may restrict access to that specific instance of the content to disrupt an ongoing unlawful attack or malware campaign that is leveraging the GitHub platform as an exploit or malware CDN. In most of these instances, restriction takes the form of putting the content behind authentication, but may, as an option of last resort, involve disabling access or full removal where this is not possible (e.g. when posted as a gist). We will also contact the project owners about restrictions put in place where possible.

Restrictions are temporary where feasible, and do not serve the purpose of purging or restricting any specific dual-use content, or copies of that content, from the platform in perpetuity. While we aim to make these rare cases of restriction a collaborative process with project owners, if you do feel your content was unduly restricted, we have an [appeals process](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement) in place.

To facilitate a path to abuse resolution with project maintainers themselves, prior to escalation to GitHub abuse reports, we recommend, but do not require, that repository owners take the following steps when posting potentially harmful security research content:

*   Clearly identify and describe any potentially harmful content in a disclaimer in the project’s README.md file or source code comments.
    
*   Provide a preferred contact method for any 3rd party abuse inquiries through a SECURITY.md file in the repository (e.g. "Please create an issue on this repository for any questions or concerns"). Such a contact method allows 3rd parties to reach out to project maintainers directly and potentially resolve concerns without the need to file abuse reports.
    
    _GitHub considers the npm registry to be a platform used primarily for installation and run-time use of code, and not for research._

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-bullying-and-harassment

We do not tolerate harassment, bullying, or abuse of any kind, whether directly or by encouraging others to take part in the prohibited conduct. This includes:

*   Targeted personal attacks
*   Piling on to or orchestrating [disruptive](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-disrupting-the-experience-of-other-users) activity in a way that amounts to abuse
*   Following another user around the platform in a manner that causes intimidation
*   Making sexual advances or comments directed at another individual
*   Disingenuously participating in conversation in a way that instigates conflict or undermines sincere discussion
*   Creating alternative accounts specifically to evade moderation action taken by GitHub staff or users

Please note, not all unwelcome conduct is necessarily considered harassment. For example, disagreeing with another user or downvoting their comments may not rise to the level of harassment on our platform. In addition, sharing criticism of public figures or projects, or topics of public interest, does not necessarily fall under this policy. However, we encourage you to be mindful in how you engage with other users and the platform, as this activity may still violate our restriction on disrupting the experience of other users.

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-disrupting-the-experience-of-other-users

Being part of a community includes recognizing how your behavior affects others and engaging in meaningful and productive interactions with people and the platform they rely on.

We do not allow behavior that significantly or continually disrupts the experience of other users. This includes:

*   Posting off-topic comments
*   Opening empty or meaningless issues or pull requests
*   Starring and/or following accounts or repositories in large volume in a short period of time
*   Creating nonsensical or irrelevant code reviews
*   Engaging with platform features in a way that causes excessive notifications for other users
*   Using any other platform feature in a way that creates disruption

While we encourage maintainers to moderate their own projects on an individual basis, GitHub staff may take further restrictive action against accounts that are engaging in these types of behaviors.

Please note that the above conduct may also violate other restrictions in our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies). For example, depending on the nature and severity of the activity, it may rise to the level of [bullying and harassment](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-bullying-and-harassment).

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-doxxing-and-invasion-of-privacy

Don't post other people's personal information. This includes:

*   Personal, private email addresses
*   Phone numbers
*   Physical addresses or other private location information
*   Bank account information or credit card numbers
*   Social Security/National Identity numbers
*   Passwords
*   Voter information
*   Medical information and personal biometric data
*   Other private information that may pose a safety or security risk

We may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment.

GitHub will take context into account as well as whether the reported content is publicly available elsewhere. Please note, however, that while sharing publicly available content may not be a violation of this policy, if the information is shared with the intent to harass or incite other abusive behavior, it may violate our prohibition against [bullying and harassment](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-bullying-and-harassment).

For more information, or to learn how to report a violation, see our [Private Information Removal Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy) and our instructions for [Reporting Abuse](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam).

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-hate-speech-and-discrimination

GitHub does not tolerate speech that attacks or promotes hate toward an individual or group of people on the basis of who they are, including age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or sexual orientation. This includes:

*   Mocking, attacking, or excluding a person or group based on their beliefs or the characteristics listed above
*   Displaying clear affiliation or identification with known terrorist or violent extremist organizations
*   Supporting or promoting hate groups or hate-based conspiracy theories
*   Sharing symbols or images synonymous with hate
*   Using harmful stereotypes, slurs, or dehumanizing speech
*   Attacking an individual based on their perceived gender
*   Dog whistling; or using coded or suggestive language and/or symbols to promote abuse or hate

While GitHub takes all instances of abuse and harassment on the platform seriously, we are especially committed to fighting hate-based abuse where it disproportionately affects communities that have historically been targeted by such abuse. We aim to make GitHub a place where all individuals feel welcome and safe.

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-impersonation

You may not misrepresent your identity or your association with another person or organization. This includes doing any of the following in a way that misleads or deceives others:

*   Copying another user's avatar or other personal profile information
*   Posting content under another user's email address
*   Using a deceptively similar username, organization name, or other namespace
*   Accessing an account or organization with another user's token or credentials
*   Otherwise posing as another individual or organization

Impersonation is a form of harassment and violation of this policy may lead to loss of access to your account.

Please note, having a username similar to another is not necessarily impersonation. GitHub will take context into account. For example, as in cases involving claims of [misinformation or disinformation](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-misinformation-and-disinformation), we generally allow parody and satire that is in line with our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-misinformation-and-disinformation

You may not post content that presents a distorted view of reality, whether it is inaccurate or false (misinformation) or is intentionally deceptive (disinformation), where such content is likely to result in harm to the public or to interfere with fair and equal opportunities for all to take part in a free and open society. This may include:

*   Inaccurate or scientifically unsupported medical claims that endanger public health or safety
*   Manipulated media, whether audio or visual, likely to mislead or deceive in a way that may harm the public interest
*   False or misleading content likely to interfere with an individual's ability to participate in civic activities
*   Unsubstantiated claims that could promote hate or targeted harassment of specific groups of people

We encourage active participation in the expression of ideas, perspectives, and experiences and may not be in a position to dispute personal accounts or observations. We generally allow parody and satire that is in line with our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), and we consider context to be important in how information is received and understood. When reviewing content under this policy, GitHub will consider the impact of various factors that may help to orient the viewer, such as whether the content has been provided with clear disclaimers, citations to credible sources, or includes other details that clarify the accuracy of the information being shared.

GitHub does not allow any projects that are designed for, encourage, promote, support, or suggest in any way the use of synthetic or manipulated media for the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery or any content that would constitute misinformation or disinformation under this policy.

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-sexually-obscene-content

We do not tolerate content associated with sexual exploitation or abuse of another individual, including where minors are concerned. We do not allow sexually themed or suggestive content that serves little or no purpose other than to solicit an erotic or shocking response, particularly where that content is amplified by its placement in profiles or other social contexts. This includes:

*   Pornographic content
*   Non-consensual intimate imagery
*   Graphic depictions of sexual acts including photographs, video, animation, drawings, computer-generated images, or text-based content

We recognize that not all nudity or content related to sexuality is obscene. We may allow visual and/or textual depictions in artistic, educational, historical or journalistic contexts, or as it relates to victim advocacy. In some cases a disclaimer can help communicate the context of the project. However, please understand that we may choose to limit the content by giving users the option to opt in before viewing.

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-threats-of-violence-and-gratuitously-violent-content

You may not use GitHub to organize, promote, encourage, threaten, or incite acts of violence. You may not post content that depicts or glorifies violence or physical harm against human beings or animals. This includes:

*   Threatening another individual or group with abuse, harm, sexual violence, or death
*   Posting text, imagery, or audio content glorifying or containing a graphic depiction of violence toward oneself, another individual, group, or animal
*   Encouraging another individual to engage in self harm

We do not allow violent content to be posted indiscriminately or in a way that is difficult for other users to avoid, such as a profile avatar or an issue comment. However, we understand there may be legitimate reasons to post violent content, such as for educational or documentary purposes, creative works, or depictions of historical events. In those cases, a clear warning or disclaimer can help users make an educated decision as to whether or not they want to engage with such content. Still, GitHub may decide to limit the visibility of such content to those who choose to opt in.

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement

[Appeal and Reinstatement](#appeal-and-reinstatement)
-----------------------------------------------------

While the majority of interactions between individuals in GitHub’s community fall within our Acceptable Use Policies and Community Guidelines, violations of those policies do occur at times. When they do, GitHub staff may need to take enforcement action to address the violations. However, we understand that sometimes we might make mistakes. In some cases there may be a basis to reverse a moderation action taken (or not taken) by GitHub Staff. To ensure our policies and outcomes are applied evenly, GitHub provides an internal complaint-handling process where users can submit requests for reinstatement or provide additional information to appeal a moderation decision.

[What are Appeals and Reinstatements?](#what-are-appeals-and-reinstatements)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Appeals and Reinstatements may arise in relation to decisions to disable or limit access to content or an account, including decisions whether or not to:

*   Remove, disable access to, or restrict visibility of content
*   Suspend or terminate access to an account
*   Suspend or terminate access to the service, in whole or in part
*   Suspend, terminate or otherwise restrict the ability to monetize content

A “Reinstatement” is where a user wishes to regain access to their account or content and is willing to make any necessary changes to address the violation and agrees not to violate our terms going forward.

An “Appeal” is where a user disputes that a violation has occurred and can provide additional information to show that a different decision should have been reached.

[How this works](#how-this-works)
---------------------------------

If you seek Reinstatement or wish to Appeal an enforcement action, please fill out our [Appeal and Reinstatement form](https://support.github.com/contact/reinstatement). You may Appeal a moderation decision for up to six months following the decision. GitHub may, in its discretion, refuse to consider any Appeals submitted more than six months after the decision.

GitHub staff will review the information provided in the form to determine whether there is sufficient information to warrant Reinstatement or granting of an Appeal.

### [Reinstatements](#reinstatements)

Where a user can agree to abide by our Acceptable Use Policies moving forward and has made the changes necessary to address the violation(s), we may choose to reinstate their account or content depending on the circumstances and severity of the initial violation.

All legitimate Reinstatement requests will be reviewed initially by GitHub staff and will be answered with a decision.

### [Appeals](#appeals)

Where a user seeks to dispute a decision, they can use the form to explain their basis for disputing the decision and to provide any additional information regarding the alleged violation that they believe should have led to a different decision.

If the information provided demonstrates that a different conclusion should have been reached, we may be able to grant an Appeal. GitHub will reverse or modify its decision when the Appeal contains sufficient grounds for us to determine that (i) our decision to act or not to act was mistaken; (ii) that the content or conduct was not illegal and not incompatible with our Terms; or (iii) that the content or conduct warrants a lesser severity of action than the measure taken.

All decisions on Appeal are made by humans and not by any automated means. If the GitHub Staff reviewer on the Appeal is the same person who made the initial determination and that staff member believes their initial conclusion was correct (and thus would be inclined to deny the Appeal), a different member of GitHub’s staff will independently review the Appeal.

All legitimate Appeals will be answered with a final decision.

[Transparency](#transparency)
-----------------------------

We track Appeals and Reinstatements in our [Transparency Center](https://transparencycenter.github.com/appeals/).

### [Legal Rights](#legal-rights)

If you believe that a final decision made on Appeal is still incorrect you may, in certain circumstances, have additional rights to seek review of the decision under your local law. For example, if you are located in the European Union, it might be possible to access an out-of-court dispute settlement process under the [Digital Services Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj#d1e2819-1-1).

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement

[GitHub Privacy Statement](#github-privacy-statement)
-----------------------------------------------------

Effective date: February 1, 2024

Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data”, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the “Data Controller” when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, “Services”). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.

### [End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts](#end-user-notice-organization-provided-github-accounts)

When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:

*   Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.
*   Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.

Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.

In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.

### [Third Party Access and Data Protection](#third-party-access-and-data-protection)

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

[Personal Data We Collect](#personal-data-we-collect)
-----------------------------------------------------

Personal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties. The Personal Data GitHub processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications), the features you use (such as pull requests, Codespaces, or GitHub Copilot) and your method of accessing the Services (your preferred IDE).

[Private repositories: GitHub Access](#private-repositories-github-access)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your GitHub account has private repositories, you control the access to that information. GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:

*   security purposes
*   automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
*   to assist the repository owner with a support matter
*   to maintain the integrity of the Services, or
*   to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.

GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)](#lawful-bases-for-processing-personal-data-applicable-to-eea-and-uk-end-users)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub processes Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR, ensuring a lawful basis for each processing activity. The basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. Our processing activities typically fall under these lawful bases:

*   Contractual Necessity: Processing is required to fulfill our contractual duties to you, in accordance with the GitHub Terms of Service.
*   Legal Obligation: We process data when it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, safety, and property of GitHub, our affiliates, users, or third parties.
*   Legitimate Interests: We process data for purposes that are in our legitimate interests, such as securing our Services, communicating with you, and improving our Services. This is done only when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
*   Consent: We process data when you have explicitly consented to such processing. When we rely on consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing at any time. The procedures for withdrawal are detailed in this Statement and available on our website.

To exercise these rights, please send an email to privacy\[at\]github\[dot\]com and follow the instructions provided. To verify your identity for security, we may request extra information before addressing your data-related request. Please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo\[at\]github\[dot\]com for any feedback or concerns. Depending on your region, you have the right to complain to your local Data Protection Authority. European users can find authority contacts on the European Data Protection Board website, and UK users on the Information Commissioner’s Office website.

We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

[International data transfers](#international-data-transfers)
-------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under [Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the [European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

[Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](#data-privacy-framework-dpf)
-----------------------------------------------------------

GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### [Dispute resolution process](#dispute-resolution-process)

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo\[at\]github\[dot\]com.

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [https://go.adr.org/dpf\_irm.html](https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html) for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are provided at no cost to you.

An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2).

### [Government Enforcement](#government-enforcement)

GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.

[Security and Retention](#security-and-retention)
-------------------------------------------------

GitHub uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We’ll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.

[Our use of cookies and tracking technologies](#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking-technologies)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Cookies and tracking technologies](#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

#### [What are cookies and similar technologies?](#what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### [How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?](#how-do-we-and-our-partners-use-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

Purpose

Description

Required Cookies

GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.

Analytics

We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.

Social Media

GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.

Advertising

In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.

#### [What are your cookie choices and controls?](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls)

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

1.  **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**
    
    Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
    
    Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
    
2.  **Generally for all websites** You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
    

*   If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
*   Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
*   You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
*   Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
*   United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
*   Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
*   Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

[US State Specific Information](#us-state-specific-information)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”

### [Privacy Rights](#privacy-rights)

These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:

*   Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we’ve collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information.

Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.
*   Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.
*   Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.

### [Notice of Collection of Personal Information](#notice-of-collection-of-personal-information)

Under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing (privacy\[at\]github\[dot\]com). Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-candidate-privacy-policy

Effective Date: March 8, 2021

This GitHub Candidate Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you during the application or recruitment process for employment with GitHub, as well as the purposes for which we collect and use that information.

For the purposes of this policy:

“Candidate” includes applicants and candidates who are part of the GitHub application or recruitment process; and

"Candidate Personal Information" refers to any information we collect about one of our Candidates during the application or recruitment process which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them.

This policy does not apply to the use of GitHub services, which are covered under our [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

[What Candidate Personal Information do we collect?](#what-candidate-personal-information-do-we-collect)

*   If you were referred, to inform the referrer of the status of your application;
*   If you are offered a position, to prepare your offer letter and conduct a background check (to the extent permitted by applicable law);
*   If you are offered a position and where requested by you, to assist you with obtaining an immigration visa or work permit;
*   To comply with local laws, regulations, legal processes or enforceable government requests; and
*   To prepare and submit reports as required under local laws and regulations;
*   To manage and improve our application and recruitment process (such as making the application process more efficient and improving our diversity practices).

GitHub will share your Candidate Personal Information with those who have a legitimate business need for it. Whenever we permit a third party to access your Candidate Personal Information, we will make sure the information is used in a manner consistent with this policy. Your Candidate Personal Information may be shared with our affiliates (such as Microsoft) and other third parties (such as vendors) for the following purposes:

1.  In order to carry out the uses of Candidate Personal Information described above;
2.  To enable third parties to provide products or services to us or on our behalf (such as to facilitate the application process or conduct background checks).

4.  As necessary to establish, exercise, or defend against potential or pending litigation;
5.  Where necessary to protect GitHub, your vital interests (such as safety and security), or those of another person; or

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls

GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Server, and the information you upload to either product may be subject to trade control regulations, including under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the EAR).

GitHub’s vision is to be the global platform for developer collaboration, no matter where developers reside. We take seriously our responsibility to examine government sanctions thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repository services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions. This also means GitHub will advocate for developers in sanctioned regions to enjoy greater access to the platform and full access to the global open source community.

As a result of our advocacy and hard work with U.S. regulators, GitHub has secured a license from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to restore our cloud services to developers in Iran. And we will continue to work with U.S. regulators to secure similar licenses to offer collaboration services to developers in other sanctioned regions, such as Syria and Crimea. We are committed to advocating for the broadest possible developer access, as we believe offering code collaboration services for developers in sanctioned regions makes the global developer community stronger, advances human progress, and supports the enduring U.S. foreign policy of promoting free speech and the free flow of information. For information about the license we secured for developers in Iran, read [the blog post](https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran).

Although we've provided the following information below for your convenience, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that your use of GitHub's products and services complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. export control laws.

[Export overview](#export-overview)
-----------------------------------

### [GitHub.com](#githubcom)

Under our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), users may only access and use GitHub.com in compliance with applicable law, including U.S. export control and sanctions laws.

Users are responsible for ensuring that the content they develop and share on GitHub.com complies with the U.S. export control laws, including the EAR and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The cloud-hosted service offering available at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) has not been designed to host data subject to the ITAR and does not currently offer the ability to restrict repository access by country. If you are looking to collaborate on ITAR- or other export-controlled data, we recommend you consider [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://enterprise.github.com/), GitHub's on-premises offering.

GitHub now has a license from OFAC to provide cloud services to developers located or otherwise resident in Iran. This includes all public and private services for individuals and organizations, both free and paid.

GitHub cloud services, both free and paid, are also generally available to developers located in Cuba.

Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), other denied or blocked parties under U.S. and other applicable law, and certain government officials, may be restricted from accessing or using GitHub.com. Additionally, users may not use GitHub.com for or on behalf of such parties, generally including the Governments of sanctioned countries. Furthermore, GitHub.com may not be used for purposes prohibited under applicable export control laws, including prohibited end uses described in [15 CFR 744](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ad384e1f1e017076f8c0136f322f0a4c&mc=true&node=pt15.2.744&rgn=div5).

### [GitHub Enterprise Server](#github-enterprise-server)

GitHub Enterprise Server is a self-hosted virtual appliance that can be run within your own datacenter or virtual private cloud. As such, GitHub Enterprise Server can be used to store ITAR- or other export-controlled information, although, end users are nonetheless responsible for ensuring compliance with the ITAR and other applicable export controls.

GitHub Enterprise Server is a commercial, mass-market product and has been assigned the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) of `5D992.c` and may be exported to most destinations with no license required (NLR).

GitHub Enterprise Server may not be sold to, exported, or re-exported to any country listed in Country Group E:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR or to the following regions of Ukraine: Crimea and the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. The countries listed currently include Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, and Belarus, but this list is subject to change.

### [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)

GitHub Copilot is a commercial, mass-market product and has been assigned the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) of 5D992.c and may be exported to most destinations with no license required (NLR).

GitHub Copilot may not be sold, exported, or re-exported to any embargoed destination or a country listed in Country Group E:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR without authorization. These destinations currently include Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Belarus, and the following regions of Ukraine: Crimea/Sevastopol and the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. This list is subject to change.

[Frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)
---------------------------------------------------------

### [On which countries and territories are U.S. government sanctions applied?](#on-which-countries-and-territories-are-us-government-sanctions-applied)

Crimea, the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. With respect to Iran, however, GitHub now has a license from the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to provide cloud services to developers located or otherwise resident in that country. GitHub cloud services, both free and paid, are also generally available to developers located in Cuba.

### [How is GitHub ensuring that folks not living in and/or having professional links to the sanctioned countries and territories still have access or ability to appeal?](#how-is-github-ensuring-that-folks-not-living-in-andor-having-professional-links-to-the-sanctioned-countries-and-territories-still-have-access-or-ability-to-appeal)

In the rare instance that an account is affected unintentionally or in error, we have an appeal process to address such instances.

If an individual user or organization owner believes that they have been flagged in error, then that user has the opportunity to appeal the flag by providing verification information to GitHub. If GitHub receives sufficient information to verify that the user or organization is not affiliated with a U.S.-sanctioned jurisdiction for which we do not have a license or otherwise restricted by U.S. economic sanctions, then the flag will be removed. Please see [individual account appeals request form](https://airtable.com/shrGBcceazKIoz6pY) and [organizational account appeals request form](https://airtable.com/shrB2je5RBkqLEt5D).

### [Will traveling in these regions be impacted?](#will-traveling-in-these-regions-be-impacted)

Travel in these regions may impact your account status, but availability may be reinstated once you are outside of the sanctioned region and upon submitting a successful [individual account appeals request](https://airtable.com/shrGBcceazKIoz6pY) or an [organizational account appeals request](https://airtable.com/shrB2je5RBkqLEt5D).

### [What is available and not available?](#what-is-available-and-not-available)

GitHub now has a license from OFAC to provide cloud services to developers located or otherwise resident in the U.S.-sanctioned country of Iran. The license includes all public and private services for individuals and organizations, both free and paid. GitHub cloud services, both free and paid, are also generally available to developers located in Cuba.

GitHub is committed to continuing to offer free public repository services to developers with individual and organizational accounts in Syria, Crimea, and the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. This includes limited access to free services, such as public repositories for open source projects (and associated public Pages), public gists, and allotted free Action minutes, for personal communications only, and not for commercial purposes.

For paid organizational accounts in these sanctioned regions, users may have limited access to their public repositories, which have been downgraded to archived read-only repositories. For free organizational accounts in these sanctioned regions, however, users will continue to have full access to free public repositories for open source projects (and associated public Pages), public gists, and allotted free Action minutes.

GitHub will continue advocating with U.S. regulators for the greatest possible access to code collaboration services to developers in sanctioned regions, such as Syria and Crimea, including private repositories. We believe that offering those services advances human progress, international communication, and the enduring U.S. foreign policy of promoting free speech and the free flow of information.

Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), other denied or blocked parties under U.S. and other applicable law, and certain government officials may be restricted from accessing or using GitHub, wherever located. Users may not use GitHub.com for or on behalf of such parties, generally including the Governments of sanctioned countries.

GitHub services are not available to developers located or otherwise resident in North Korea.

### [How do you define these specific users?](#how-do-you-define-these-specific-users)

If GitHub determines that a user or customer is located in a region that is subject to U.S. trade control restrictions for which GitHub does not yet have a license from the U.S. government, or a user is otherwise restricted under U.S. economic sanctions, then the affiliated account will be restricted to comply with those legal requirements. The determination of user and customer location to implement these legal restrictions are derived from a number of sources, including IP addresses and payment history. Nationality and ethnicity are not used to flag users for sanctions restrictions.

### [How are organization accounts impacted?](#how-are-organization-accounts-impacted)

If an organization is based out of, or the key individuals or membership of an organization shows sufficient ties to, a sanctioned territory or country for which GitHub does not yet have a license from the U.S. government, or if the organization otherwise appears to be subject to U.S. economic sanctions, then the organization account and the affiliated owner account will be restricted.

The restriction suspends access to private repository services and paid services, such as availability of free or paid private repositories, secret gists, paid Action minutes, Sponsors, and GitHub Marketplace services. For paid organizational accounts associated with such sanctioned regions, users may have limited access to their public repositories, which have been downgraded to archived read-only repositories. For free organizational accounts associated with such sanctioned regions, users will continue to have full access to free public repositories for open source projects (and associated public Pages), public gists, and allotted free Action minutes.

### [Can trade-restricted users’ private repositories be made public?](#can-trade-restricted-users-private-repositories-be-made-public)

Free individual account users can make restricted private repositories public, for personal communications only, and not for commercial purposes. Users can do this by navigating to the repository settings tab and clicking the "make public" button. Once the repository is public, users have access to public repositories services. This action cannot be undone.

### [Can trade-restricted users access private repository data (e.g. downloading or deletion of repository data)?](#can-trade-restricted-users-access-private-repository-data-eg-downloading-or-deletion-of-repository-data)

Unfortunately, our understanding of the law does not give us the option to allow downloads or deletion of private repository content, until otherwise authorized by the U.S. government. We will strongly advocate, with U.S. regulators, for the right of trade-restricted users to secure the contents of their private repositories. We will also advocate for more availability of GitHub services for developers in sanctioned markets, and further underscore the importance of code collaboration in supporting personal communications for developers globally.

### [Under the license GitHub has received from OFAC, which types of accounts will be available in Iran?](#under-the-license-github-has-received-from-ofac-which-types-of-accounts-will-be-available-in-iran)

The license we have secured includes all public and private services, for individuals and organizations, both free and paid.

For example, a developer in Iran may sign up for a Free or Pro plan for their individual use, and an Iranian university may set up an organization account to collaborate with students.

Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), other denied or blocked parties under U.S. and other applicable law, and certain government officials may be restricted from accessing or using GitHub.

If GitHub determines that an individual or organization falls into a restricted category (SDNs, other blocked parties, or certain government officials), their account will be flagged and they will not be able to use any GitHub features. If they believe that they have been flagged in error, then they have the opportunity to appeal the flag by providing verification information to GitHub using our [individual account appeals request form or organization account appeals request form](https://airtable.com/shrGBcceazKIoz6pY). If GitHub receives sufficient information to verify that the individual is not in a category restricted by U.S. economic sanctions, then the flag will be removed.

### [Will Iranian GitHub users be able to use paid services under the license?](#will-iranian-github-users-be-able-to-use-paid-services-under-the-license)

Pursuant to the license we have received from OFAC, we are restoring all cloud services to Iranian users, including paid services. We accept all major credit cards, but third parties process payments for us, so payments are subject to the terms and conditions of our payment processors. Those third parties may include restrictions that block payments from Iran.

### [Can you clarify availability of GitHub to Cuban developers?](#can-you-clarify-availability-of-github-to-cuban-developers)

GitHub cloud services, both free and paid, are generally available to developers located in Cuba.  
Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), other denied or blocked parties under U.S. and other applicable law, and certain government officials may be restricted from accessing or using GitHub, wherever located. Additionally, users may not use GitHub.com for or on behalf of such parties, generally including the Governments of sanctioned countries.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-government-takedown-policy

[What is this?](#what-is-this)
------------------------------

From time to time, GitHub receives requests from governments to remove content that has been declared unlawful in their local jurisdiction. Although we may not always agree with those laws, we may need to block content if we receive a complete request from a government official so that our users in that jurisdiction may continue to have access to GitHub to collaborate and build software.

[What is a complete government takedown request?](#what-is-a-complete-government-takedown-request)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To count as a complete request, a request or notice must

*   come from a relevant, official government agency
*   identify illegal content
*   specify the source of illegality in that jurisdiction (law or court order).

[What happens when we receive a complete takedown request from a government?](#what-happens-when-we-receive-a-complete-takedown-request-from-a-government)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we receive a notice from a relevant, official government agency that identifies illegal content and specifies the source of the illegality, we

*   notify the affected users of the specific content that allegedly violates the law, and that this is a legal takedown request
*   allow the affected users to appeal the decision as part of that notification
*   limit the geographic scope of the takedown when possible and include that as part of the notification
*   post the official request that led to the takedown in our public [gov-takedowns repository](https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns).

[Why do we publicly post takedown notices?](#why-do-we-publicly-post-takedown-notices)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are concerned about Internet censorship, and believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good governance. By publicly posting the notices, we can better inform the public about what content is being withheld from GitHub, and why. We post takedown notices to document their potential to chill speech.

[What does it mean if we post a notice in our gov-takedowns repository?](#what-does-it-mean-if-we-post-a-notice-in-our-gov-takedowns-repository)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does _not_ mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does _not_ mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.

[Government takedowns based on violations of GitHub's Terms of Service](#government-takedowns-based-on-violations-of-githubs-terms-of-service)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, GitHub receives reports from government officials of violations of GitHub's Terms of Service. We process those violations as we would process a Terms-of-Service violation reported by anyone else. However, we notify the affected users that the report came from a government and, as with any other case, allow them the opportunity to appeal.

[Transparency reporting](#transparency-reporting)
-------------------------------------------------

In addition to posting government takedown notices in our `github/gov-takedowns` repository, we report on them in our transparency report. We also track and report in our transparency report on government takedowns based on violations of GitHub's Terms of Service.

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-username-policy

GitHub account names are available on a first-come, first-served basis, and are intended for immediate and active use.

[What if the username I want is already taken?](#what-if-the-username-i-want-is-already-taken)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that not all activity on GitHub is publicly visible; accounts with no visible activity may be in active use.

If the username you want has already been claimed, consider other names or unique variations. Using a number, hyphen, or an alternative spelling might help you identify a desirable username that's still available.

[Trademark Policy](#trademark-policy)
-------------------------------------

If you believe someone's account is violating your trademark rights, you can find more information about making a trademark complaint on our [Trademark Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy) page.

[Name Squatting Policy](#name-squatting-policy)
-----------------------------------------------

GitHub prohibits account name squatting, and account names may not be reserved or inactively held for future use. Accounts violating this name squatting policy may be removed or renamed without notice. Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data

Are you a law enforcement officer conducting an investigation that may involve user content hosted on GitHub? Or maybe you're a privacy-conscious person who would like to know what information we share with law enforcement and under what circumstances. Either way, you're on the right page.

In these guidelines, we provide a little background about what GitHub is, the types of data we have, and the conditions under which we will disclose private user information. Before we get into the details, however, here are a few important details you may want to know:

*   We will [**notify affected users**](#we-will-notify-any-affected-account-owners) about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order.
*   We will not disclose **location-tracking data**, such as IP address logs, without a [valid court order or search warrant](#with-a-court-order-or-a-search-warrant).
*   We will not disclose any **private user content**, including the contents of private repositories, without a valid [search warrant](#only-with-a-search-warrant).

[About these guidelines](#about-these-guidelines)
-------------------------------------------------

Our users trust us with their software projects and code—often some of their most valuable business or personal assets. Maintaining that trust is essential to us, which means keeping user data safe, secure, and private.

While the overwhelming majority of our users use GitHub's services to create new businesses, build new technologies, and for the general betterment of humankind, we recognize that with millions of users spread all over the world, there are bound to be a few bad apples in the bunch. In those cases, we want to help law enforcement serve their legitimate interest in protecting the public.

By providing guidelines for law enforcement personnel, we hope to strike a balance between the often competing interests of user privacy and justice. We hope these guidelines will help to set expectations on both sides, as well as to add transparency to GitHub's internal processes. Our users should know that we value their private information and that we do what we can to protect it. At a minimum, this means only releasing data to third-parties when the appropriate legal requirements have been satisfied. By the same token, we also hope to educate law enforcement professionals about GitHub's systems so that they can more efficiently tailor their data requests and target just that information needed to conduct their investigation.

[GitHub terminology](#github-terminology)
-----------------------------------------

Before asking us to disclose data, it may be useful to understand how our system is implemented. GitHub hosts millions of data repositories using the [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control). Repositories on GitHub—which may be public or private—are most commonly used for software development projects, but are also often used to work on content of all kinds.

*   [**Users**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#user): Users are represented in our system as personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories. Users can create or be invited to join organizations or to collaborate on another user's repository.
    
*   [**Collaborators**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#collaborator): A collaborator is a user with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.
    
*   [**Organizations**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#organization): Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations, such as businesses or projects. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams of users.
    
*   [**Repositories**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#repository): A repository is one of the most basic GitHub elements. They may be easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and, at its administrators' discretion, may be publicly viewable or not.
    
*   [**Pages**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages): GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted by GitHub that users can easily publish through code stored in their repositories. If a user or organization has a GitHub Page, it can usually be found at a URL such as `https://username.github.io` or they may have the webpage mapped to their own custom domain name.
    
*   [**Gists**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists): Gists are snippets of source code or other text that users can use to store ideas or share with friends. Like regular GitHub repositories, Gists are created with Git, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and downloadable. Gists can either be public or secret (accessible only through a known URL). Public Gists cannot be converted into secret Gists.
    

[User data on GitHub.com](#user-data-on-githubcom)
--------------------------------------------------

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the kinds of data we maintain about users and projects on GitHub.

*   **Public account data:** There is a variety of information publicly available on GitHub about users and their repositories. User profiles can be found at a URL such as `https://github.com/username`. User profiles display information about when the user created their account as well their public activity on GitHub.com and social interactions. Public user profiles can also include additional information that a user may have chosen to share publicly. All user public profiles display:
    
    *   Username
        
    *   The repositories that the user has starred
        
    *   The other GitHub users the user follows
        
    *   The users that follow them
        
        Optionally, a user may also choose to share the following information publicly:
        
    *   Their real name
        
    *   An avatar
        
    *   An affiliated company
        
    *   Their location
        
    *   A public email address
        
    *   Their personal web page
        
    *   Organizations to which the user is a member (_depending on either the organizations' or the users' preferences_)
        
*   **Private account data:** GitHub also collects and maintains certain private information about users as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). This may include:
    
    *   Private email addresses
        
    *   Payment details
        
    *   Security access logs
        
    *   Data about interactions with private repositories
        
        To get a sense of the type of private account information that GitHub collects, you can visit your [personal dashboard](https://github.com/dashboard) and browse through the sections in the left-hand menubar.
        
*   **Organization account data:** Information about organizations, their administrative users and repositories is publicly available on GitHub. Organization profiles can be found at a URL such as `https://github.com/organization`. Public organization profiles can also include additional information that the owners have chosen to share publicly. All organization public profiles display:
    
    *   The organization name
        
    *   The repositories that the owners have starred
        
    *   All GitHub users that are owners of the organization
        
        Optionally, administrative users may also choose to share the following information publicly:
        
    *   An avatar
        
    *   An affiliated company
        
    *   Their location
        
    *   Direct Members and Teams
        
    *   Collaborators
        
*   **Public repository data:** GitHub is home to millions of public, open-source software projects. You can browse almost any public repository (for example, the [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs)) to get a sense for the information that GitHub collects and maintains about repositories. This can include:
    
    *   The code itself
    *   Previous versions of the code
    *   Stable release versions of the project
    *   Information about collaborators, contributors and repository members
    *   Logs of Git operations such as commits, branching, pushing, pulling, forking and cloning
    *   Conversations related to Git operations such as comments on pull requests or commits
    *   Project documentation such as Issues and Wiki pages
    *   Statistics and graphs showing contributions to the project and the network of contributors
*   **Private repository data:** GitHub collects and maintains the same type of data for private repositories that can be seen for public repositories, except only specifically invited users may access private repository data.
    
*   **Other data:** Additionally, GitHub collects analytics data such as page visits and information occasionally volunteered by our users (such as communications with our support team, survey information and/or site registrations).
    

[We will notify any affected account owners](#we-will-notify-any-affected-account-owners)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is our policy to notify users about any pending requests regarding their accounts or repositories, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so. Before disclosing user information, we will make a reasonable effort to notify any affected account owner(s) by sending a message to their verified email address providing them with a copy of the subpoena, court order, or warrant so that they can have an opportunity to challenge the legal process if they wish. In (rare) exigent circumstances, we may delay notification if we determine delay is necessary to prevent death or serious harm or due to an ongoing investigation.

[Disclosure of non-public information](#disclosure-of-non-public-information)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is our policy to disclose non-public user information in connection with a civil or criminal investigation only with user consent or upon receipt of a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order, search warrant, or other similar valid legal process. In certain exigent circumstances (see below), we also may share limited information but only corresponding to the nature of the circumstances, and would require legal process for anything beyond that. GitHub reserves the right to object to any requests for non-public information. Where GitHub agrees to produce non-public information in response to a lawful request, we will conduct a reasonable search for the requested information. Here are the kinds of information we will agree to produce, depending on the kind of legal process we are served with:

*   **With user consent:** GitHub will provide private account information, if requested, directly to the user (or an owner, in the case of an organization account), or to a designated third party with the user's written consent once GitHub is satisfied that the user has verified his or her identity.
    
*   **With a subpoena:** If served with a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar legal process issued in connection with an official criminal or civil investigation, we can provide certain non-public account information, which may include:
    
    *   Name(s) associated with the account
    *   Email address(es) associated with the account
    *   Billing information
    *   Registration date and termination date
    *   IP address, date, and time at the time of account registration
    *   IP address(es) used to access the account at a specified time or event relevant to the investigation

In the case of organization accounts, we can provide the name(s) and email address(es) of the account owner(s) as well as the date and IP address at the time of creation of the organization account. We will not produce information about other members or contributors, if any, to the organization account or any additional information regarding the identified account owner(s) without a follow-up request for those specific users.

Please note that the information available will vary from case to case. Some of the information is optional for users to provide. In other cases, we may not have collected or retained the information.

*   **With a court order _or_ a search warrant:** We will not disclose account access logs unless compelled to do so by either (i) a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), upon a showing of specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation; or (ii) a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, upon a showing of probable cause. In addition to the non-public account information listed above, we can provide account access logs in response to a court order or search warrant, which may include:
    
    *   Any logs which would reveal a user's movements over a period of time
    *   Account or private repository settings (for example, which users have certain permissions, etc.)
    *   User- or IP-specific analytic data such as browsing history
    *   Security access logs other than account creation or for a specific time and date
*   **Only with a search warrant:** We will not disclose the private contents of any account unless compelled to do so under a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause. In addition to the non-public account information and account access logs mentioned above, we will also provide private account contents in response to a search warrant, which may include:
    
    *   Contents of secret Gists
    *   Source code or other content in private repositories
    *   Contribution and collaboration records for private repositories
    *   Communications or documentation (such as Issues or Wikis) in private repositories
    *   Any security keys used for authentication or encryption
*   **Under exigent circumstances:** If we receive a request for information under certain exigent circumstances (where we believe the disclosure is necessary to prevent an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person), we may disclose limited information that we determine necessary to enable law enforcement to address the emergency. For any information beyond that, we would require a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, as described above. For example, we will not disclose contents of private repositories without a search warrant. Before disclosing information, we confirm that the request came from a law enforcement agency, an authority sent an official notice summarizing the emergency, and how the information requested will assist in addressing the emergency.
    

[Cost reimbursement](#cost-reimbursement)
-----------------------------------------

Under state and federal law, GitHub can seek reimbursement for costs associated with compliance with a valid legal demand, such as a subpoena, court order or search warrant. We only charge to recover some costs, and these reimbursements cover only a portion of the costs we actually incur to comply with legal orders.

While we do not charge in emergency situations or in other exigent circumstances, we seek reimbursement for all other legal requests in accordance with the following schedule, unless otherwise required by law:

*   Initial search of up to 25 identifiers: Free
*   Production of subscriber information/data for up to 5 accounts: Free
*   Production of subscriber information/data for more than 5 accounts: $20 per account
*   Secondary searches: $10 per search

[Data preservation](#data-preservation)
---------------------------------------

We will take steps to preserve account records for up to 90 days upon formal request from U.S. law enforcement in connection with official criminal investigations, and pending the issuance of a court order or other process.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy

Welcome to GitHub's Guide to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, commonly known as the "DMCA." This page is not meant as a comprehensive primer to the statute. However, if you've received a DMCA takedown notice targeting content you've posted on GitHub or if you're a rights-holder looking to issue such a notice, this page will hopefully help to demystify the law a bit as well as our policies for complying with it.

(If you just want to submit a notice, you can skip to [G. Submitting Notices](#g-submitting-notices).)

As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.

[What Is the DMCA?](#what-is-the-dmca)
--------------------------------------

In order to understand the DMCA and some of the policy lines it draws, it's perhaps helpful to consider life before it was enacted.

The DMCA provides a safe harbor for service providers that host user-generated content. Since even a single claim of copyright infringement can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000, the possibility of being held liable for user-generated content could be very harmful for service providers. With potential damages multiplied across millions of users, cloud-computing and user-generated content sites like YouTube, Facebook, or GitHub probably [never would have existed](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/how-the-dmca-made-youtube/) without the DMCA (or at least not without passing some of that cost downstream to their users).

The DMCA addresses this issue by creating a [copyright liability safe harbor](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512) for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content. Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright infringement based on user-generated content. Because of this, it is important for GitHub to maintain its DMCA safe-harbor status.

The DMCA also prohibits the [circumvention of technical measures](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html) that effectively control access to works protected by copyright.

[DMCA Notices In a Nutshell](#dmca-notices-in-a-nutshell)
---------------------------------------------------------

The DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all GitHub users should know about: (i) a [takedown-notice](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice) procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a [counter-notice](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice) procedure for users to get content re-enabled when content is taken down by mistake or misidentification.

DMCA [takedown notices](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice) are used by copyright owners to ask GitHub to take down content they believe to be infringing. If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day. If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on GitHub, you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed.

On the other hand, [counter notices](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice) can be used to correct mistakes. Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. Since GitHub usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up.

The DMCA notice and takedown process should be used only for complaints about copyright infringement. Notices sent through our DMCA process must identify copyrighted work or works that are allegedly being infringed. The process cannot be used for other complaints, such as complaints about alleged [trademark infringement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy) or [sensitive data](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy); we offer separate processes for those situations.

[A. How Does This Actually Work?](#a-how-does-this-actually-work)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class. The copyright owner hands GitHub a complaint about a user. If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user. If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so. GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.

Here are the basic steps in the process.

1.  **Copyright Owner Investigates.** A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm both (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on GitHub is unauthorized and infringing. This includes confirming that the use is not protected as [fair use](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22). A particular use may be fair if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately.
    
    > **Example:** An employee of Acme Web Company finds some of the company's code in a GitHub repository. Acme Web Company licenses its source code out to several trusted partners. Before sending in a take-down notice, Acme should review those licenses and its agreements to confirm that the code on GitHub is not authorized under any of them.
    
2.  **Copyright Owner Sends A Notice.** After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a [takedown notice](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice) to GitHub. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the [how-to guide](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice)), we will [post the notice](#e-transparency) to our [public repository](https://github.com/github/dmca) and pass the link along to the affected user.
    
3.  **GitHub Asks User to Make Changes.** If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a repository infringe, or a package infringes, we will skip to Step 6 and disable the entire repository or package expeditiously. Otherwise, because GitHub cannot disable access to specific files within a repository, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them approximately 1 business day to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes. Because packages are immutable, if only part of a package is infringing, GitHub would need to disable the entire package, but we permit reinstatement once the infringing portion is removed.
    
4.  **User Notifies GitHub of Changes.** If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they _must_ tell us so within the window of approximately 1 business day. If they don't, we will disable the repository (as described in Step 6). If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and then notify the copyright owner.
    
5.  **Copyright Owner Revises or Retracts the Notice.** If the user makes changes, the copyright owner must review them and renew or revise their takedown notice if the changes are insufficient. GitHub will not take any further action unless the copyright owner contacts us to either renew the original takedown notice or submit a revised one. If the copyright owner is satisfied with the changes, they may either submit a formal retraction or else do nothing. GitHub will interpret silence longer than two weeks as an implied retraction of the takedown notice.
    
6.  **GitHub May Disable Access to the Content.** GitHub will disable a user's content if: (i) the copyright owner has alleged copyright over the user's entire repository or package (as noted in Step 3); (ii) the user has not made any changes after being given an opportunity to do so (as noted in Step 4); or (iii) the copyright owner has renewed their takedown notice after the user had a chance to make changes. If the copyright owner chooses instead to _revise_ the notice, we will go back to Step 2 and repeat the process as if the revised notice were a new notice.
    
7.  **User May Send A Counter Notice.** We encourage users who have had content disabled to consult with a lawyer about their options. If a user believes that their content was disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, they may send us a [counter notice](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice). As with the original notice, we will make sure that the counter notice is sufficiently detailed (as explained in the [how-to guide](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice)). If it is, we will [post it](#e-transparency) to our [public repository](https://github.com/github/dmca) and pass the notice back to the copyright owner by sending them the link.
    
8.  **Copyright Owner May File a Legal Action.** If a copyright owner wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. In other words, you might get sued. If the copyright owner does not give GitHub notice within 10-14 days, by sending a copy of a valid legal complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, GitHub will re-enable the disabled content.
    

[B. What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?)](#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to "fork" one another's repositories. What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories. As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project. Each of these copies is a [GitHub glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#fork) of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the "parent" of the fork.

GitHub _will not_ automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. This is because forks belong to different users, may have been altered in significant ways, and may be licensed or used in a different way that is protected by the fair-use doctrine. GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks. We expect copyright owners to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks are also infringing, expressly include forks in their takedown notice.

In rare cases, you may be alleging copyright infringement in a full repository that is actively being forked. If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that repository as allegedly infringing, we would process a valid claim against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice. We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same content. In addition, if the reported network that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, "Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository." Your sworn statement would apply to this statement.

[C. What about Circumvention Claims?](#c-what-about-circumvention-claims)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DMCA prohibits the [circumvention of technical measures](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html) that effectively control access to works protected by copyright. Given that these types of claims are often highly technical in nature, GitHub requires claimants to provide [detailed information about these claims](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology), and we undertake a more extensive review.

A circumvention claim must include the following details about the technical measures in place and the manner in which the accused project circumvents them. Specifically, the notice to GitHub must include detailed statements that describe:

1.  What the technical measures are;
2.  How they effectively control access to the copyrighted material; and
3.  How the accused project is designed to circumvent their previously described technological protection measures.

GitHub will review circumvention claims closely, including by both technical and legal experts. In the technical review, we will seek to validate the details about the manner in which the technical protection measures operate and the way the project allegedly circumvents them. In the legal review, we will seek to ensure that the claims do not extend beyond the boundaries of the DMCA. In cases where we are unable to determine whether a claim is valid, we will err on the side of the developer, and leave the content up. If the claimant wishes to follow up with additional detail, we would start the review process again to evaluate the revised claims.

Where our experts determine that a claim is complete, legal, and technically legitimate, we will contact the repository owner and give them a chance to respond to the claim or make changes to the repo to avoid a takedown. If they do not respond, we will attempt to contact the repository owner again before taking any further steps. In other words, we will not disable a repository based on a claim of circumvention technology without attempting to contact a repository owner to give them a chance to respond or make changes first. If we are unable to resolve the issue by reaching out to the repository owner first, we will always be happy to consider a response from the repository owner even after the content has been disabled if they would like an opportunity to dispute the claim, present us with additional facts, or make changes to have the content restored. When we need to disable content, we will ensure that repository owners can export their issues and pull requests and other repository data that do not contain the alleged circumvention code to the extent legally possible.

Please note, our review process for circumvention technology does not apply to content that would otherwise violate our Acceptable Use Policy restrictions against sharing unauthorized product licensing keys, software for generating unauthorized product licensing keys, or software for bypassing checks for product licensing keys. Although these types of claims may also violate the DMCA provisions on circumvention technology, these are typically straightforward and do not warrant additional technical and legal review. Nonetheless, where a claim is not straightforward, for example in the case of jailbreaks, the circumvention technology claim review process would apply.

When GitHub processes a DMCA takedown under our circumvention technology claim review process, we will offer the repository owner a referral to receive independent legal consultation through [GitHub’s Developer Defense Fund](https://github.blog/2021-07-27-github-developer-rights-fellowship-stanford-law-school/) at no cost to them.

[D. What If I Inadvertently Missed the Window to Make Changes?](#d-what-if-i-inadvertently-missed-the-window-to-make-changes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We recognize that there are many valid reasons that you may not be able to make changes within the window of approximately 1 business day we provide before your repository gets disabled. Maybe our message got flagged as spam, maybe you were on vacation, maybe you don't check that email account regularly, or maybe you were just busy. We get it. If you respond to let us know that you would have liked to make the changes, but somehow missed the first opportunity, we will re-enable the repository one additional time for approximately 1 business day to allow you to make the changes. Again, you must notify us that you have made the changes in order to keep the repository enabled after that window of approximately 1 business day, as noted above in [Step A.4](#a-how-does-this-actually-work). Please note that we will only provide this one additional chance.

[E. Transparency](#e-transparency)
----------------------------------

We believe that transparency is a virtue. The public should know what content is being removed from GitHub and why. An informed public can notice and surface potential issues that would otherwise go unnoticed in an opaque system. We post redacted copies of any legal notices we receive (including original notices, counter notices or retractions) at [https://github.com/github/dmca](https://github.com/github/dmca). We will not publicly publish your personal contact information; we will remove personal information (except for usernames in URLs) before publishing notices. We will not, however, redact any other information from your notice unless you specifically ask us to. Here are some examples of a published [notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014/2014-05-28-Delicious-Brains.md) and [counter notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014/2014-05-01-Pushwoosh-SDK-counternotice.md) for you to see what they look like. When we remove content, we will post a link to the related notice in its place.

Please also note that, although we will not publicly publish unredacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it.

[F. Repeated Infringement](#f-repeated-infringement)
----------------------------------------------------

It is the policy of GitHub, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole discretion, to disable and terminate the accounts of users who may infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of GitHub or others.

[G. Submitting Notices](#g-submitting-notices)

[Learn More and Speak Up](#learn-more-and-speak-up)
---------------------------------------------------

If you poke around the Internet, it is not too hard to find commentary and criticism about the copyright system in general and the DMCA in particular. While GitHub acknowledges and appreciates the important role that the DMCA has played in promoting innovation online, we believe that the copyright laws could probably use a patch or two—if not a whole new release. In software, we are constantly improving and updating our code. Think about how much technology has changed since 1998 when the DMCA was written. Doesn't it just make sense to update these laws that apply to software?

We don't presume to have all the answers. But if you are curious, here are a few links to scholarly articles and blog posts we have found with opinions and proposals for reform:

GitHub doesn't necessarily endorse any of the viewpoints in those articles. We provide the links to encourage you to learn more, form your own opinions, and then reach out to your elected representative(s) (e.g., in the [U.S. Congress](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members) or [E.U. Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home)) to seek whatever changes you think should be made.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy

We offer this private information removal process as an exceptional service only for high-risk content that violates [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#3-conduct-restrictions), such as when your security is at risk from exposed access credentials. This guide describes the information GitHub needs from you in order to process a request to remove private information from a repository.

[What is Private Information?](#what-is-private-information)
------------------------------------------------------------

For the purposes of this document, “private information” refers to content that (i) should have been kept confidential, _and_ (ii) whose public availability poses a specific or targeted security risk to you or your organization.

"Security risk" refers to a situation involving exposure to physical danger, identity theft, or increased likelihood of unauthorized access to physical or network facilities.

### [Private information removal requests are appropriate for:](#private-information-removal-requests-are-appropriate-for)

*   Access credentials, such as user names combined with passwords, access tokens, or other sensitive secrets that can grant access to your organization's server, network, or domain.
*   AWS tokens and other similar access credentials that grant access to a third party on your behalf. You must be able to show that the token does belong to you.
*   Documentation (such as network diagrams or architecture) that poses a specific security risk for an organization.
*   [Information](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-doxxing-and-invasion-of-privacy) related to, and posing a security risk to, you as an individual (such as social security numbers or other government identification numbers).

### [Private information removal requests are _not_ appropriate for:](#private-information-removal-requests-are-not-appropriate-for)

*   Internal server names, IP addresses, and URLs, on their own. You must be able to show that their use in a particular file or piece of code poses a security threat.
*   Mere mentions of your company's identity, name, brand, domain name, or other references to your company in files on GitHub. You must be able to articulate why a use of your company's identity is a threat to your company's security posture.
*   Entire files or repositories that do not pose a specific security risk, but you believe are otherwise objectionable.
*   Requests to remove content that may infringe your or your organization's copyright rights. If you have questions about how GitHub handles copyright-related matters or would like to report potentially infringing content, please review our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). The private information removal process is generally not intended for the removal of full files or repositories — only for the specific pieces of private information in those files. While there may be cases where files are filled entirely with private information, you must justify the security risk for the removal of such files, and this may increase the time required to process your request.
*   Trademark disputes. If you have questions about how GitHub handles trademark-related matters or would like to report content containing your organization's trade or service marks, please review our [Trademark Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy).
*   Privacy complaints. If you wish to access, transfer, change, or delete your personal information on GitHub, please contact us via [our Privacy contact form](https://github.com/contact/privacy).
*   Content governed by our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines), such as malware or general-purpose tools. If you have questions about our Community Guidelines or believe that content on GitHub might violate our guidelines, you can contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) to report content.

[Things to Know](#things-to-know)
---------------------------------

**Ask Nicely First.** A great first step before sending us a request to remove data is to try contacting the user directly. They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README or Support file, or you could get in touch by creating an issue or pull request in the repository. This is not strictly required, but it is appreciated.

**No Bots.** You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every request you send. If you're outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints often include data that does not pose any security threats, and they do not include sufficient explanations, requiring additional back-and-forth and resulting in delays, even when the complaint is valid.

**Send In The Correct Request.** As noted above, we offer this private information removal process as an exceptional service only for high-risk content. We are not able to use this process to remove other kinds of content, such as potentially infringing content, and we are not able to process any other kinds of removal requests simultaneously while processing private information removal requests. We will be able to help you more quickly if you send in your private information removal requests separately from any requests to remove potentially infringing content. If you are unsure whether your request involves only private information or also involves other legal matters, please consult legal counsel.

**Processing Time.** While we do process private information removal requests as quickly as possible, due to the volume of requests we process, it may take some time for your request to be reviewed. Additional requests, or multiple requests from additional points of contact, may result in delays.

[How Does This Actually Work?](#how-does-this-actually-work)
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Complainant Investigates.** It is up to the requesting party to conduct their own investigation and to provide us with the [details we require](#your-request-must-include) — most importantly, an explanation of how the data poses a security risk. GitHub is not in a position to search for or make initial determinations about private information on any individual's or organization's behalf.
    
2.  **Complainant Sends a Private Information Removal Request.** After conducting an investigation, the complainant prepares and [sends a private information removal request](#sending-a-private-information-removal-request) to GitHub. If the request is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate the security risk and for GitHub to locate the data, we will reply and ask for more information.
    
3.  **GitHub Asks User to Make Changes.** In most cases, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them an opportunity to delete or modify the private information specified in the request or to dispute the claim.
    
4.  **User Notifies GitHub of Changes.** If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the window of time they've been allowed. If they don't, we will disable the repository. If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and notify the complainant.
    
    OR
    
5.  **User May Dispute the Request.** If a user believes the content in question is not private information subject to this Policy, they may dispute it. If they do, we will generally leave it up to the complainant to contact the user and work things out with them directly, within reason.
    
6.  **Complainant Reviews Changes.** If the user makes changes, the complainant must review them. If the changes are insufficient, the complainant must provide GitHub with details explaining why. GitHub may disable the repository or give the user an additional chance to make the changes.
    
7.  **User May Request an Additional Window to Make Changes.** If the user missed their opportunity to remove the private information specified in the notice, we may allow them an additional window of approximately 1 business day, upon request, to make those changes. In that event, GitHub will notify the complainant.
    

### [What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?)](#what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork)

One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to "fork" one another's repositories. What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories. As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project. Each of these copies is a [GitHub glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#fork) of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the "parent" of the fork.

GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. This is because forks belong to different users and may have been altered in significant ways. GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks. We expect those sending private information removal requests to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks also contain private information, expressly include forks in their request.

If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that repository, we would process a valid claim against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice. We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same content. In addition, if the reported network that contains the reported content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, based on the representative number of forks you have reviewed, you believe that all or most of the forks contain the content reported in the parent repository.

[Sending A Private Information Removal Request](#sending-a-private-information-removal-request)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible. In order for us to verify that a user has removed reported private information completely, we need to know exactly where to look.

These guidelines are designed to make the processing of requests to remove private information as straightforward as possible.

### [Your Request Must Include:](#your-request-must-include)

1.  A working, clickable link to each file containing private information. (Note that we're not able to work from search results, examples, or screenshots.)
2.  Specific line numbers within each file containing the private information.
3.  A brief description of how each item you've identified poses a security risk to you or your organization. _**It is important that you provide an explanation of how the data poses a security risk beyond merely stating that it does.**_
4.  If you are a third party acting as an agent for an organization facing a security risk, include a statement that you have a legal right to act on behalf of that organization.
5.  OPTIONAL: Let us know if your request is particularly urgent, and why. We respond to all private information removal requests as quickly as possible. However, if this request is especially time-sensitive, such as a very recent credential exposure, please explain why.

[How to Submit Your Request](#how-to-submit-your-request)
---------------------------------------------------------

You can submit your request to remove private information via our [contact form](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=docs-private-information). Please include a plain-text version of your request in the body of your message. Sending your request in an attachment may result in processing delays.

[Disputes](#disputes)
---------------------

If you received a private information removal request from us, you can dispute it by replying to our email and letting us know — in as much detail as possible — why you think the content in question is not private information subject to this Policy.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy

[What is a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation?](#what-is-a-github-trademark-policy-violation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse others with regard to its brand or business affiliation may be considered a trademark policy violation.

[What is not a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation?](#what-is-not-a-github-trademark-policy-violation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using another's trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a trademark policy violation. GitHub user names are available on a first come, first served basis and may not be reserved. A GitHub account with a user name that happens to be the same as a registered trademark is not, by itself, necessarily a violation of our trademark policy.

[How Does GitHub Respond To Reported Trademark Policy Violations?](#how-does-github-respond-to-reported-trademark-policy-violations)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we receive reports of trademark policy violations from holders of federal or international trademark registrations, we review the account and may take the following actions:

*   When there is a clear intent to mislead others through the unauthorized use of a trademark, GitHub will suspend the account and notify the account holder.
*   When we determine that an account appears to be confusing users, but is not purposefully passing itself off as the trademarked good or service, we give the account holder an opportunity to clear up any potential confusion. We may also release a username for the trademark holder's active use.

[How Do I Report a Trademark Policy Violation?](#how-do-i-report-a-trademark-policy-violation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Holders of registered trademarks can report possible trademark policy violations to GitHub via [Submit a Trademark Policy Violation Report](https://support.github.com/contact/trademark-policy). Please use the contact form and submit trademark-related requests using your company email address and include all the information requested below to help expedite our response. Also be sure to clearly describe to us why the account may cause confusion with your mark or how the account may dilute or tarnish your mark.

[What Information is Required When Reporting Trademark Policy Violations?](#what-information-is-required-when-reporting-trademark-policy-violations)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to investigate trademark policy violations, please provide all of the following information:

*   Username of the reported account
    
*   Your company name
    
*   Your company GitHub account (if there is one)
    
*   Company website
    
*   Your trademarked word, symbol, etc.
    
*   Trademark registration number
    
*   Trademark registration office (e.g., USPTO)
    
*   Description of confusion (e.g., passing off as your company, including specific descriptions of content or behavior)
    
*   Requested Action (e.g., removal of violating account or transfer of trademarked username to an existing company account)
    
*   Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the trademark described above is not authorized by the trademark owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken nominative and other fair uses into consideration."
    
*   Also include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the trademark owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
    
*   Include your physical or electronic signature.
    
*   Note: A federal or international trademark registration number is required. If the name you are reporting is **not** a registered mark (e.g., a government agency or non-profit organization), please let us know:
    
    *   Your first and last name
    *   Title
    *   Address
    *   Phone
    *   Email (must be from company domain)

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice

This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a counter notice to a DMCA takedown request. If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy).

If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice. If you do, we will wait 10-14 days and then re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action against you before then. Our counter-notice form, set forth below, is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: [https://www.copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/).

As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.

[Before You Start](#before-you-start)
-------------------------------------

_**Tell the Truth.**_ The DMCA requires that you swear to your counter notice _under penalty of perjury_. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (_See_ [U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap79-sec1621.htm).) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability—that is, you could get sued for money damages.

_**Investigate.**_ Submitting a DMCA counter notice can have real legal consequences. If the complaining party disagrees that their takedown notice was mistaken, they might decide to file a lawsuit against you to keep the content disabled. You should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the takedown notice and probably talk to a lawyer before submitting a counter notice.

_**You Must Have a Good Reason to Submit a Counter Notice.**_ In order to file a counter notice, you must have "a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled." ([U.S. Code, Title 17, Section 512(g)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512).) Whether you decide to explain why you believe there was a mistake is up to you and your lawyer, but you _do_ need to identify a mistake before you submit a counter notice. In the past, we have received counter notices citing mistakes in the takedown notice such as: the complaining party doesn't have the copyright; I have a license; the code has been released under an open-source license that permits my use; or the complaint doesn't account for the fact that my use is protected by the fair-use doctrine. Of course, there could be other defects with the takedown notice.

_**Copyright Laws Are Complicated.**_ Sometimes a takedown notice might allege infringement in a way that seems odd or indirect. Copyright laws are complicated and can lead to some unexpected results. In some cases a takedown notice might allege that your source code infringes because of what it can do after it is compiled and run. For example:

*   The notice may claim that your software is used to [circumvent access controls](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html) to copyrighted works.
*   [Sometimes](https://www.copyright.gov/docs/mgm/) distributing software can be copyright infringement, if you induce end users to use the software to infringe copyrighted works.
*   A copyright complaint might also be based on [non-literal copying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) of design elements in the software, rather than the source code itself — in other words, someone has sent a notice saying they think your _design_ looks too similar to theirs.

These are just a few examples of the complexities of copyright law. Since there are many nuances to the law and some unsettled questions in these types of cases, it is especially important to get professional advice if the infringement allegations do not seem straightforward.

_**A Counter Notice Is A Legal Statement.**_ We require you to fill out all fields of a counter notice completely, because a counter notice is a legal statement — not just to us, but to the complaining party. As we mentioned above, if the complaining party wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. In other words, you might get sued (and you consent to that in the counter notice).

_**Your Counter Notice Will Be Published.**_ As noted in our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#d-transparency), **after redacting personal information,** we publish all complete and actionable counter notices at [https://github.com/github/dmca](https://github.com/github/dmca). Please also note that, although we will only publicly publish redacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it. If you are concerned about your privacy, you may have a lawyer or other legal representative file the counter notice on your behalf.

_**GitHub Isn't The Judge.**_ GitHub exercises little discretion in this process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.

_**Additional Resources.**_ If you need additional help, there are many self-help resources online. Lumen has an informative set of guides on [copyright](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/5) and [DMCA safe harbor](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/14). If you are involved with an open-source project in need of legal advice, you can contact the [Software Freedom Law Center](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/about/contact/). And if you think you have a particularly challenging case, non-profit organizations such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance) may also be willing to help directly or refer you to a lawyer.

[Your Counter Notice Must...](#your-counter-notice-must)
--------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Include the following statement: "I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice."** We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete counter notice if you don't include this statement; however, we will know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so.
    
2.  _**Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared.**_ The disabled content should have been identified by URL in the takedown notice. You simply need to copy the URL(s) that you want to challenge.
    
3.  **Provide your contact information.** Include your email address, name, telephone number, and physical address.
    
4.  _**Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."**_ You may also choose to communicate the reasons why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification. If you think of your counter notice as a "note" to the complaining party, this is a chance to explain why they should not take the next step and file a lawsuit in response. This is yet another reason to work with a lawyer when submitting a counter notice.
    
5.  _**Include the following statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person."**_
    
6.  **Include your physical or electronic signature.**
    

[How to Submit Your Counter Notice](#how-to-submit-your-counter-notice)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our [Copyright claims form](https://github.com/contact/dmca).

You can also send an email notification to [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message.

If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take _substantially_ longer for us to receive and respond to it—and the 10-14 day waiting period starts from when we _receive_ your counter notice. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is:

    GitHub, Inc
    Attn: DMCA Agent
    88 Colin P Kelly Jr St

[Before You Start](#before-you-start)
-------------------------------------

_**Tell the Truth.**_ The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint _under penalty of perjury_. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (_See_ [U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap79-sec1621.htm).) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued for money damages. The DMCA itself [provides for damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#%C2%A7_512\(f\)_Misrepresentations) against any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing.

_**Investigate.**_ Millions of users and organizations pour their hearts and souls into the projects they create and contribute to on GitHub. Filing a DMCA complaint against such a project is a serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people. Because of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown to make sure that the use isn't actually permissible.

_**Ask Nicely First.**_ A great first step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly. They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README, or you could get in touch by opening an issue or pull request on the repository. This is not strictly required, but it is classy.

_**Send In The Correct Request.**_ We can only accept DMCA takedown notices for works that are protected by copyright, and that identify a specific copyrightable work. If you have a complaint about trademark abuse, please see our [trademark policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy). If you wish to remove sensitive data such as passwords, please see our [policy on sensitive data](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy). If you are dealing with defamation or other abusive behavior, please see our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

_**Code Is Different From Other Creative Content.**_ GitHub is built for collaboration on software code. This makes identifying a valid copyright infringement more complicated than it might otherwise be for, say, photos, music, or videos.

There are a number of reasons why code is different from other creative content. For instance:

*   A repository may include bits and pieces of code from many different people, but only one file or even a sub-routine within a file infringes your copyrights.
*   Code mixes functionality with creative expression, but copyright only protects the expressive elements, not the parts that are functional.
*   There are often licenses to consider. Just because a piece of code has a copyright notice does not necessarily mean that it is infringing. It is possible that the code is being used in accordance with an open-source license.
*   A particular use may be [fair-use](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22) if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately.
*   Code may be alleged to infringe in many different ways, requiring detailed explanations and identifications of works.

This list isn't exhaustive, which is why speaking to a legal professional about your proposed complaint is doubly important when dealing with code.

_**No Bots.**_ You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send. If you are outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down projects!

_**Matters of Copyright Are Hard.**_ It can be very difficult to determine whether or not a particular work is protected by copyright. For example, facts (including data) are generally not copyrightable. Words and short phrases are generally not copyrightable. URLs and domain names are generally not copyrightable. Since you can only use the DMCA process to target content that is protected by copyright, you should speak with a lawyer if you have questions about whether or not your content is protectable.

_**You May Receive a Counter Notice.**_ Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a [counter notice](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice). If they do, we will re-enable their content within 10-14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub.

_**Your Complaint Will Be Published.**_ As noted in our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#d-transparency), after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable takedown notices at [https://github.com/github/dmca](https://github.com/github/dmca).

_**GitHub Isn't The Judge.**_ GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.

[Your Complaint Must ...](#your-complaint-must-)
------------------------------------------------

1.  **Include the following statement: "I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."** We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete complaint if you don't include this statement. But we'll know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so.
    
2.  **Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.** This information is important because it helps the affected user evaluate your claim and give them the ability to compare your work to theirs. The specificity of your identification will depend on the nature of the work you believe has been infringed. If you have published your work, you might be able to just link back to a web page where it lives. If it is proprietary and not published, you might describe it and explain that it is proprietary. If you have registered it with the Copyright Office, you should include the registration number. If you are alleging that the hosted content is a direct, literal copy of your work, you can also just explain that fact.
    
3.  **Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above.** It is important to be as specific as possible in your identification. This identification needs to be reasonably sufficient to permit GitHub to locate the material. At a minimum, this means that you should include the URL to the material allegedly infringing your copyright. If you allege that less than a whole repository infringes, identify the specific file(s) or line numbers within a file that you allege infringe. If you allege that all of the content at a URL infringes, please be explicit about that as well.
    
    *   Please note that GitHub will _not_ automatically disable [forks](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork) when disabling a parent repository. If you have investigated and analyzed the forks of a repository and believe that they are also infringing, please explicitly identify each allegedly infringing fork. Please also confirm that you have investigated each individual case and that your sworn statements apply to each identified fork. In rare cases, you may be alleging copyright infringement in a full repository that is actively being forked. If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that repository as allegedly infringing, we would process a valid claim against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice. We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same content. In addition, if the reported network that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, "Based on the representative number of forks you have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository." Your sworn statement would apply to this statement.
4.  **Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement.** Again, specificity is important. When we pass your complaint along to the user, this will tell them what they need to do in order to avoid having the rest of their content disabled. Does the user just need to add a statement of attribution? Do they need to delete certain lines within their code, or entire files? Of course, we understand that in some cases, all of a user's content may be alleged to infringe and there's nothing they could do short of deleting it all. If that's the case, please make that clear as well.
    
5.  **Provide your contact information.** Include your email address, name, telephone number and physical address.
    
6.  **Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer.** Usually this will be satisfied by providing the GitHub username associated with the allegedly infringing content. But there may be cases where you have additional knowledge about the alleged infringer. If so, please share that information with us.
    
7.  **Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
    
8.  **Also include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**
    
9.  **Include your physical or electronic signature.**
    

[Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology](#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Copyright Act also prohibits the circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access to works protected by copyright. If you believe that content hosted on GitHub violates this prohibition, please send us a report through our [Copyright claims form](https://github.com/contact/dmca). A circumvention claim must include the following details about the technical measures in place and the manner in which the accused project circumvents them. Specifically, the notice to GitHub must include detailed statements that describe:

1.  What the technical measures are;
2.  How they effectively control access to the copyrighted material; and
3.  How the accused project is designed to circumvent their previously described technological protection measures.

[How to Submit Your Complaint](#how-to-submit-your-complaint)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our [Copyright claims form](https://github.com/contact/dmca).

You can also send an email notification to [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message.

If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take _substantially_ longer for us to receive and respond to it. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is:

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/security-policies/coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities

We want to keep GitHub safe for everyone. If you've discovered a security vulnerability in GitHub, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a coordinated manner.

[Bounty Program](#bounty-program)
---------------------------------

Like several other large software companies, GitHub provides a bug bounty to better engage with security researchers. The idea is simple: hackers and security researchers (like you) find and report vulnerabilities through our coordinated disclosure process. Then, to recognize the significant effort that these researchers often put forth when hunting down bugs, we reward them with some cold hard cash.

Check out the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) site for bounty details, review our comprehensive [Legal Safe Harbor Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/security-policies/github-bug-bounty-program-legal-safe-harbor) terms as well, and happy hunting!

---

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/security-policies/github-bug-bounty-program-legal-safe-harbor

[Summary](#summary)
-------------------

1.  We want you to coordinate disclosure through our bug bounty program, and don't want researchers put in fear of legal consequences because of their good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy. We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume this protection extends to any third party. If in doubt, ask us before engaging in any specific action you think _might_ go outside the bounds of our policy.
2.  Because both identifying and non-identifying information can put a researcher at risk, we limit what we share with third parties. We may provide non-identifying substantive information from your report to an affected third party, but only after notifying you and receiving a commitment that the third party will not pursue legal action against you. We will only share identifying information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) with a third party if you give your written permission.
3.  If your security research as part of the bug bounty program violates certain restrictions in our site policies, the safe harbor terms permit a limited exemption.

[1\. Safe Harbor Terms](#1-safe-harbor-terms)
---------------------------------------------

To encourage research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities, we will not pursue civil or criminal action, or send notice to law enforcement for accidental or good faith violations of this policy. We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy to be “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in this bug bounty program's scope.

Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a third party (which is not us), we cannot bind that third party, and they may pursue legal action or law enforcement notice. We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities, and cannot in any way offer to defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based on your actions.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all laws applicable to you, and not to disrupt or compromise any data beyond what this bug bounty program permits.

Please contact us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy. We reserve the sole right to make the determination of whether a violation of this policy is accidental or in good faith, and proactive contact to us before engaging in any action is a significant factor in that decision. If in doubt, ask us first!

[2\. Third Party Safe Harbor](#2-third-party-safe-harbor)
---------------------------------------------------------

If you submit a report through our bug bounty program which affects a third party service, we will limit what we share with any affected third party. We may share non-identifying content from your report with an affected third party, but only after notifying you that we intend to do so and getting the third party's written commitment that they will not pursue legal action against you or initiate contact with law enforcement based on your report. We will not share your identifying information with any affected third party without first getting your written permission to do so.

Please note that we cannot authorize out-of-scope testing in the name of third parties, and such testing is beyond the scope of our policy. Refer to that third party's bug bounty policy, if they have one, or contact the third party either directly or through a legal representative before initiating any testing on that third party or their services. This is not, and should not be understood as, any agreement on our part to defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based on your actions.

That said, if legal action is initiated by a third party, including law enforcement, against you because of your participation in this bug bounty program, and you have sufficiently complied with our bug bounty policy (i.e. have not made intentional or bad faith violations), we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy. While we consider submitted reports both confidential and potentially privileged documents, and protected from compelled disclosure in most circumstances, please be aware that a court could, despite our objections, order us to share information with a third party.

[3\. Limited Waiver of Other Site Policies](#3-limited-waiver-of-other-site-policies)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the extent that your security research activities are inconsistent with certain restrictions in our [relevant site policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy) but consistent with the terms of our bug bounty program, we waive those restrictions for the sole and limited purpose of permitting your security research under this bug bounty program. Just like above, if in doubt, ask us first!

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-company-policies/github-statement-against-modern-slavery-and-child-labor

_2018 statement_

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), [40 million people were victims of modern slavery and 152 million children were subject to child labor](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_574717/lang--en/index.htm) globally in 2016. As the [ILO reports](https://www.ilo.org/topics-and-sectors/forced-labour-modern-slavery-and-trafficking-persons):

*   1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children.
*   Out of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labour, 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labour imposed by state authorities.
*   Women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labour, accounting for 99% of victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors.

GitHub deplores the presence and persistence of modern slavery and child labor, and takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that neither modern slavery nor child labor takes place in its supply chain or in any part of its business. ("Modern slavery" in this statement refers to slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, and workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded. "Child labor" refers to work performed by someone under 16 years of age, or under 14 for light work, provided it is not confined to periods that interfere with the child's schooling and not in conditions that interfere with the child's health or well-being.)

In accordance with the [UK Modern Slavery Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/section/54/enacted), and in alignment with the [ILO 2014 Protocol to its Forced Labour Convention](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:P029), [ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work](https://www.ilo.org/ilo-declaration-fundamental-principles-and-rights-work), and [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target 8.7](https://www.unodc.org/roseap/en/sustainable-development-goals.html#:~:text=Target%208.7%20%2D%20Take%20immediate%20and,labour%20in%20all%20its%20forms), this 2018 Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor ("the Statement") describes the steps GitHub has taken to prevent modern slavery and child labor from occurring in its business or supply chain.

[GitHub's structure, business, and supply chains](#githubs-structure-business-and-supply-chains)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub is a software development platform with its headquarters in San Francisco, and employees and contractors working in numerous countries.

All GitHub employees and individual independent contractors are voluntary and at-will. GitHub has a largely distributed workforce, and strives to provide competitive compensation and benefits to its employees and contractors regardless of location. This is true whether we hire independent contractors directly or through an intermediary.

GitHub does not conduct manufacturing or produce hardware, nor does GitHub use recruitment agencies for the kinds of services often performed by migrant workers. The nature of GitHub's business does not subject it to sudden changes in workload or pricing pressures, which often drive demand for practices that increase the risk of forced labor in supply chains, such as forced overtime.

GitHub offers free and paid software and web-based software as a service to customers all over the world. GitHub's products include:

*   GitHub.com: web-based collaboration and code-hosting platform
*   GitHub Enterprise: on-premises collaboration and code hosting software
*   Electron: framework for writing cross-platform desktop apps
*   GitHub Desktop: desktop app for accessing GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise

GitHub's supply chain consists of goods and services for our products and operations including computing services, event planning, purchase of retail and promotional items, office supplies, and leasing of facilities such as office space and data centers.

[Policies in relation to modern slavery and child labor](#policies-in-relation-to-modern-slavery-and-child-labor)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Modern slavery and child labor](#modern-slavery-and-child-labor)

**GitHub's Code of Ethics** prohibits knowingly using, participating in, supporting, or tolerating modern slavery (slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, or workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded) or child labor in its business operations. Any GitHub employee or contractor who violates this prohibition will be subject to termination of employment or business relationship.

**GitHub's Standards of Conduct** prohibit unsafe and illegal conduct, including knowingly using, participating in, supporting, or tolerating modern slavery (slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, or workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded) or child labor.

GitHub complies with laws prohibiting trafficking and child labor in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including [U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation 22.17 on combatting human trafficking](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2009-title48-vol1/pdf/CFR-2009-title48-vol1-part22-subpart22-17.pdf).

In addition, GitHub established a partnership with the FairHotel Program, which means GitHub encourages its employees to choose FairHotel endorsed hotels-where workers have fair wages, adequate benefits, and a voice on the job. Being a FairHotel partner also signifies that GitHub provides business to hotels as a fair employer.

Going forward, GitHub will communicate this Statement to all employees, contractors, and suppliers, including recruiters and employment agencies. In addition, GitHub is developing training for all GitHub employees on modern slavery and child labor. GitHub posts its Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor publicly.

GitHub has a non-retaliation policy for reporting workplace-related concerns. Consistent with this Statement, GitHub allows employees and contractors to report issues regarding modern slavery and child labor without fear of retaliation.

[Labor laws and practices](#labor-laws-and-practices)
-----------------------------------------------------

GitHub's labor practices are

**fair:**

*   GitHub pays its employees and contractors a fair wage, in accordance with applicable legal wages
*   GitHub maintains humane working conditions
*   GitHub does not require workers to exceed the maximum hours of daily labor set by local and national laws or regulations
*   GitHub pays its employees and contractors in a timely manner, with documentation (such as a pay stub) stating the basis on which they are paid, and keeps employee records in accordance with local and national laws

**humane and ethical:**

*   GitHub uses only voluntary labor
*   GitHub prohibits child labor
*   GitHub does not engage in physical discipline or abuse
*   GitHub does not tolerate harassment or unlawful discrimination in the workforce or workplace

**respectful:**

*   GitHub protects its employees' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with legal requirements, including to post legal notices of employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act
*   GitHub provides benefits to employees at or in excess of levels expected in the industry
*   GitHub encourages employees to report any workplace complaint and does not tolerate retaliation for reporting

[Due diligence processes in relation to modern slavery and child labor in its business and supply chains](#due-diligence-processes-in-relation-to-modern-slavery-and-child-labor-in-its-business-and-supply-chains)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub assesses its business and supply chain for risks related to modern slavery and child labor. Drawing on internal and external human rights expertise, GitHub engaged in a cross-functional analysis (including Policy, Legal, Procurement, Finance, and Operations, especially Human Resources) to determine where labor services exist in its business and supply chain and to identify potential risks related to modern slavery and child labor. GitHub prioritizes areas where those risks might be more significant in terms of severity, scale, or probability for greater due diligence, monitoring, and verification. GitHub continues to consider where risks may occur and how to address them. In addition, GitHub now obtains its suppliers' assurance that they have practices consistent with this Statement, including by complying with laws related to modern slavery or child labor.

[Places in GitHub's business and supply chains where there is a risk of modern slavery and child labor, and steps GitHub has taken to assess and manage that risk](#places-in-githubs-business-and-supply-chains-where-there-is-a-risk-of-modern-slavery-and-child-labor-and-steps-github-has-taken-to-assess-and-manage-that-risk)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub has not identified any high-risk suppliers; however, modern slavery or child labor would be more likely to occur with suppliers for services involving manual labor, such as event support, construction, facilities services, and food services. GitHub will audit its existing suppliers and require those in such higher risk areas to confirm that they provide services consistent with this Statement.

Although GitHub knows of no actual or alleged modern slavery or child labor in its business or supply chain, and has no credible basis to believe it is occurring, GitHub is committed to providing remedies if GitHub itself were to directly cause modern slavery or child labor and to remediation of broader patterns of non-conformance with this Statement caused by deficiencies in GitHub's systems or processes. GitHub's remediation to individual victims would include protocols for appropriate immediate action to eliminate the modern slavery and child labor practices, along with resources for reasonable and appropriate victim services designed to offset the harm experienced.

[Effectiveness in ensuring neither modern slavery nor child labor is occurring in GitHub's business or supply chains](#effectiveness-in-ensuring-neither-modern-slavery-nor-child-labor-is-occurring-in-githubs-business-or-supply-chains)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub complies and will continue to comply with laws related to modern slavery and child labor.

Going forward, GitHub now requires its suppliers to comply with this Statement, as well as laws related to modern slavery and child labor. GitHub now also requires its suppliers to:

*   Not use, participate in, support, or tolerate modern slavery or child labor
*   Not use misleading or fraudulent recruitment or engagement practices for employees or contract workers
*   Not charge employees or contract workers recruitment or engagement fees
*   Not destroy, conceal, confiscate, or otherwise deny access by an employee or any contract worker to passport, driver's license, or other identity documents;
*   Allow us to terminate our agreements with them for any violation of its obligations related to modern slavery or child labor; and
*   Remediate any harms caused to any worker found to be subjected to any form of modern slavery or child labor, if required by law.

In addition, GitHub strongly encourages its suppliers to:

*   Conduct anti-modern slavery and child labor due diligence processes, including risk assessments, for their suppliers;
*   Take steps to address risks identified; and
*   Use similar anti-modern slavery and child labor language with their suppliers.

GitHub's procurement instructions to employees making company purchases now includes a reference to the requirement for suppliers to comply with Microsoft's Supplier Code of Conduct or this Statement.

[Training for GitHub staff about modern slavery and human trafficking](#training-for-github-staff-about-modern-slavery-and-human-trafficking)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub is developing modern slavery and child labor training that will be mandatory for all employees, with a view to GitHub's business and supply chain. GitHub will emphasize suppliers providing services involving manual labor, such as event support, construction, facilities services, and food services, as areas of greater potential risk.

**GitHub's Board of Directors approved this Statement. See a [copy of this statement signed by GitHub's Chief Strategy Officer and General Counsel (PDF)](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/site-policy/github-statement-against-modern-slavery-and-child-labor.pdf).**

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-company-policies/github-anti-bribery-statement

GitHub upholds our commitment to ethical business practices, including by prohibiting bribery and corruption. As [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/what-is-corruption) explains, the costs of corruption are

*   **political**, by posing a major obstacle to democracy and the rule of law
*   **economic**, by depleting national wealth
*   **social**, by undermining people’s trust in political society, institutions, and leaders
*   **environmental**, by facilitating non-enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.

[GitHub policies prohibiting bribery](#github-policies-prohibiting-bribery)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub makes our anti-bribery commitment clear in a number of company policies. As part of the Microsoft family, GitHub is also committed to Microsoft's Anti-Corruption Policy, which applies to all GitHub employees and contractors, in addition to the policies described here.

GitHub's **Code of Ethics** prohibits employees and contractors from engaging in or contributing to bribery or corruption, and establishes record-keeping requirements:

> You must never pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, induce, accept, or authorize payment of anything else of value, to anyone—including to anyone in a position of power or authority, such as government officials, or in commercial transactions—in order to obtain or keep business, or secure any other improper advantage for GitHub or Microsoft. You also must not solicit or accept a bribe, kickback, or any other improper cash payment. ... \[GitHub employees\] are required to keep accurate and fair records of all transactions involving any expense made on GitHub’s behalf—for example, by keeping receipts and providing accurate descriptions of your expenses—or any other transaction involving the disposal or transfer of GitHub assets. Such actions are required by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which GitHub does business and are also simply the right thing to do.

GitHub's Code of Ethics elaborates on certain situations, including gifts, travel, and entertainment; facilitating payments; charitable donations; jobs; and working with representatives, as well as on who is considered a government official.

GitHub's Standards of Conduct prohibit:

> Bribing government officials or other individuals to gain an unfair advantage, and taking bribes from anyone.

GitHub’s **Gifts and Entertainment Policy** explains that bribery is not permitted in connection with travel or entertainment, and provides examples to illustrate improper conduct. The policy describes proper and improper gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses; company processes for gift-giving by GitHub’s directors, officers, employees, and agents and requirements for record-keeping, penalties; and reporting of violations. It includes clear monetary thresholds for gifts along with annual limitations, with limited exceptions for gifts approved by appropriate management. The policy is clear and easily accessible to GitHub employees and contractors.

[Training for our employees](#training-for-our-employees)
---------------------------------------------------------

GitHub employees are required to participate in training on corruption, including bribery. We also provide additional training for particularly relevant people and teams, such as our sales team. The training explains relevant elements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. For example,

*   definition and structural effects of corruption
*   who is covered, including
    *   public officials or others in a position of power
    *   third parties
*   what kind of activity is covered, including
    *   cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment
    *   facilitation payments
    *   charitable contributions and sponsorship
*   for what purpose, including
    *   intent
    *   improper advantage or influence
*   due diligence and red flags
*   record-keeping requirements

In addition, the training covers GitHub’s internal policies related to anti-corruption and bribery, including our non-retaliation (whistleblower) policy.

While the U.S. FCPA is focused on interactions with government officials, the U.K. Bribery Act is broader and extends to bribing anyone, regardless of whether they are a government official. Both laws can extend to GitHub’s actions elsewhere on the globe. GitHub’s policies prohibit bribing anyone, anywhere in the world.

[Engaging our Partners](#engaging-our-partners)
-----------------------------------------------

*   GitHub’s standard **resale agreements with Channel Partners** include mandatory anti-corruption clauses. Going forward, GitHub now requires our Channel Partners to commit to complying with this Anti-Corruption Statement.
*   Going forward, GitHub’s **vendor contracts** now require a commitment to comply with Microsoft's Supplier Code of Conduct or this Anti-Corruption Statement.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-company-policies/github-gpl-cooperation-commitment

This commitment pertains to GitHub contributions to Git, the Linux kernel, and other programs under covered licenses (scroll to the end for definitions).

We based our statement on the [template](https://github.com/gplcc/gplcc/blob/master/Company/GPL%20Cooperation%20Commitment-Company-Template.md) for companies.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-company-policies/github-gifts-and-entertainment-policy

GitHub recognizes that our business is built on positive and transparent relationships. While informal interactions and exchanges of gifts may be part of developing those relationships and may even be considered customary in some countries, we need to ensure that we’re following anti-bribery laws. We have a legal obligation to behave ethically, including by not using such interactions to create a special advantage or influence a deal.

[Company policies](#company-policies)
-------------------------------------

As a reminder, our Code of Ethics states:

> You must never pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, induce, accept, or authorize payment of anything else of value, to anyone—including to anyone in a position of power or authority, such as government officials, or in commercial transactions—in order to obtain or keep business, or secure any other improper advantage for GitHub or Microsoft. You also must not solicit or accept a bribe, kickback, or any other improper cash payment. ... \[GitHub employees\] are required to keep accurate and fair records of all transactions involving any expense made on GitHub’s behalf—for example, by keeping receipts and providing accurate descriptions of your expenses—or any other transaction involving the disposal or transfer of GitHub assets. Such actions are required by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which GitHub does business and are also simply the right thing to do.

GitHub's Code of Ethics elaborates on certain situations, including gifts, travel, and entertainment; facilitating payments; charitable donations; jobs; and working with representatives, as well as on who is considered a government official.

Our Standards of Conduct prohibit:

> Bribing government officials or other individuals to gain an unfair advantage, and taking bribes from anyone.

That means not only no cash or cash equivalent of any kind, but nothing of value, should be given to anyone (including civil servants, government officials, or anyone in a position of power or authority, as well as people not in any of those privileged positions) in order to influence them or taken from anyone to influence GitHub. Such activity is prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Anti-Bribery laws, both of which govern GitHub’s actions globally.

[Examples of acceptable and unacceptable gifts](#examples-of-acceptable-and-unacceptable-gifts)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what does “of value” mean? Keep in mind that no gifts are acceptable for government officials (ok, maybe stickers). You should always ask them what their policies permit and prohibit. But if in doubt, please run it by Legal to make sure. For example, many U.S. congresspeople will not let you take them out for dinner and pay.

As for other customers or prospective customers, certain things might seem trivial but have great value to someone else. For example, although it might not seem like a big deal to you to get your friend’s daughter hired as an intern, it might be of huge value to them. But if she is not qualified and you pull strings to make it happen, then it isn't ok. In addition, if the intention is to improperly influence, anything, however small, might be considered "of value."

🙅 _Here are some other things that aren't ok:_

*   First class airfare to GitHub offices for Executive Briefings ✈️+🍾
*   Winery tours 🍷
*   Recommending a friend’s kid to a prestigious private school for admission 🎓
*   Tickets to Disneyland 👸, the World Cup 🥅, the Olympics 🏅
*   A futbol ⚽️ autographed by a famous player
*   A contribution to a charity

🙆 _Here is some stuff that is actually ok for customers or prospective customers:_

*   Swag
*   Economy class airfare to GitHub offices for Executive Briefings ✈️
*   Bleacher-type tickets to a sporting event ⚾️
*   A reasonably priced dinner in town 🍽
*   A small box of chocolates as an end of year thank you 🍫

All of the above applies to _taking_ bribes too. So if a vendor or prospective vendor sends you something “of value,” don’t accept it—or at least run it by Legal before you do.

[Process](#process)
-------------------

If you are planning to provide or accept an informal gift (that is not one of our promotional items like t-shirts and sticker swag), please make sure to follow the process below.

Keep in mind that what's an acceptable amount can vary. For example, spending $50 on dinner might be considered a lot of money in some countries but not as much in others. So, when in doubt, ask!

1.  Generally speaking, for any expenses exceeding $150, you'll need approval (each time) from Legal in writing. And for any gifts you receive exceeding $150, you'll need to report that (each time) to Legal in writing. (Legal is just weighing in on the bribery question. You might still need to check with Finance for other reasons.)
    
2.  When you submit your expense report for reimbursement, please:
    
    *   Indicate the recipient and the purpose of the gift in the notes; and
    *   Include a copy of the email approval

[Consequences](#consequences)
-----------------------------

What happens if you don’t follow the policy and GitHub ends up paying for a prospective customer and his family to fly first class to Japan and attend the Tokyo Olympics? Or if you drop off a suitcase of Euros for a government official in a pre-arranged train station locker?

FINES and JAIL. Not necessarily just for GitHub, either. You might get to spend a few years in jail, yourself, and it won’t matter if the customer ever submitted an order to GitHub after their trip to Japan or if the government official even picked up the suitcase of cash. Basically, it doesn’t matter whether you actually _made_ a bribe. Yoda notwithstanding, it’s the trying that counts.

[More information](#more-information)

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users

_These terms apply to Customers who licensed the Products prior to January 4, 2021. Customers who purchase GitHub Products after that date are directed to [https://github.com/customer-terms](https://github.com/customer-terms) for current terms._

Note

This Amendment to GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) applies only to users that are using GitHub on behalf of the United States federal government. If you are not using GitHub on behalf of the U.S. federal government, the standard [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) apply to you.

This Amendment is an agreement between GitHub, Inc. ("GitHub" or "Company") and U.S. federal government users of the GitHub.com web site (the “Service”) and applies solely to any U.S. federal government agency and its users who use or access the Service on behalf of the U.S. federal government (the "Government").

You, as a United States government entity, are required, when entering into agreements with other parties, to follow applicable federal laws and regulations, including those related to ethics; privacy and security; accessibility; records retention; limitations on indemnification; fiscal law constraints; advertising and endorsements; freedom of information; and governing law and dispute resolution forum.

GitHub and You (together, the "Parties") agree that modifications to the [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) (the "ToS") are appropriate to accommodate Your legal status, Your public (in contrast to private) mission, and other special circumstances. Accordingly, the ToS are hereby modified by this Amendment as they pertain to the Government's use of the Company web site and services:

[A. Public purpose](#a-public-purpose)
--------------------------------------

1.  _Government entity_ - "You" within the ToS shall mean the Government itself and shall not bind, in their individual capacity, the individual(s) who utilize the Company site or services on the Government's behalf. Company will look solely to the Government to enforce any violation or breach of the ToS by such individuals, subject to federal law.
    
2.  _Advertisements_ - Company hereby agrees not to serve or display any third-party commercial advertisements or solicitations on any pages within the Company site displaying content created by or under the control of the Government. This exclusion shall not extend to house ads, which Company may serve on such pages in a non-intrusive manner. The foregoing obligations are contingent upon the email address designated on Your account details page ending in `.gov`, `.mil`, or `.fed.us`.
    

[B. Your content on GitHub](#b-your-content-on-github)
------------------------------------------------------

1.  _Access and use_ - Company acknowledges that the Government's use of the Service may energize significant citizen engagement. Language in the ToS allowing Company to terminate service, refuse or remove any Content, or close the Government's account, at any time, for any reason, is modified to reflect the Parties' agreement that Company may unilaterally modify or discontinue service, temporarily or permanently, refuse or remove any Content, and/or terminate the Government's account only for breach of the Government’s obligations under the ToS or its material failure to comply with the instructions and guidelines posted on the Service, or if Company ceases to operate the Service generally. Company will provide the Government with a reasonable opportunity to cure any breach or failure on the Government's part.
    
2.  _No endorsement_ - Company agrees that Your seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that You have a presence on the Company site and use its services, shall not be used by Company in such a manner as to state or imply that Company's products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by You or by any other element of the federal government, or are considered by these entities to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Government, or for links to or promotion of such pages, Company agrees not to display any government seals or logos on the Company's homepage or elsewhere on the Company Site, unless permission to do so has been granted by the Government or by other relevant federal government authority. Company may list the Government's name in a publicly available customer list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party name.
    
3.  _Provision of data_ - In case of termination of service, within 30 days of such termination, upon request, Company will provide you with all user-generated content that is publicly visible through the Sites You created at Company. Data will be provided in a commonly used file or database format as Company deems appropriate. Company will not provide data if doing so would violate its privacy policy, available at [https://docs.github.com/privacy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
    

[C. Unpaid and paid plans](#c-unpaid-and-paid-plans)
----------------------------------------------------

1.  _No cost agreement_ - Nothing in this Amendment or ToS obligates You to expend appropriations or incur financial obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that none of the obligations arising from this Amendment or ToS are contingent upon the payment of fees by one party to the other. At the Company’s discretion, GitHub may offer a free account under a free usage plan, such as a Free for Open Source Plan, and in that case this Amendment will apply to the Government’s usage under the free account/plan. This Amendment also applies when the Government uses one of GitHub’s paid usage plans.
    
2.  _Government responsibilities under paid usage plans_ - You acknowledge that while Company will provide You with service under a free plan, Company reserves the right to begin charging for that service at some point in the future. Company will provide You with at least 30 days advance notice of a change involving the charging of fees for a free service. You also understand that Company offers paid plans for a fee. The Parties understand that fee-based services are categorically different than free products, and are subject to federal procurement rules and processes. Before the Government decides to enter into a business or enterprise subscription, or any other fee-based service that this Company or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, You agree: to determine the Government has a need for those additional services for a fee; to consider the subscription's value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere; to determine that Government funds are available for payment; to properly use the Government Purchase Card if that Card is used as the payment method; to review any then-applicable ToS for conformance to federal procurement law; and in all other respects to follow applicable federal acquisition laws, regulations and agency guidelines (including those related to payments) when initiating that separate action.
    
3.  _No business relationship created_ - The Parties are independent entities and nothing in this Amendment or ToS creates an agency, partnership, joint venture, or employer/employee relationship.
    

[D. Federal Regulations](#d-federal-regulations)
------------------------------------------------

1.  _Security_ - Company will, in good faith, exercise due diligence using generally accepted commercial business practices for IT security, to ensure that systems are operated and maintained in a secure manner, and that management, operational and technical controls will be employed to ensure security of systems and data. Recognizing the changing nature of the Web, Company will continuously work with users to ensure that its products and services are operated and maintained in a secure manner. Company agrees to discuss implementing additional security controls as deemed necessary by the Government to conform to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3541 et seq.
    
2.  _Federal Records_ - Government acknowledges that use of Company's site and services may require management of Federal records. Government and user-generated content may meet the definition of Federal records as determined by the agency. If the Company holds Federal records, the Government and the Company must manage Federal records in accordance with all applicable records management laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chs. 21, 29, 31, 33), and regulations of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B). Managing the records includes, but is not limited to, secure storage, retrievability, and proper disposition of all Federal records including transfer of permanently valuable records to NARA in a format and manner acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer. The Government is responsible for ensuring that the Company is compliant with applicable records management laws and regulations through the life and termination of the Agreement.
    

[E. General Conditions](#e-general-conditions)
----------------------------------------------

1.  _Indemnification_ - Any provisions in the ToS related to indemnification, damages, attorney’s fees, and settlement are hereby waived. Liability of the Government for any breach of the ToS or this Agreement, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the ToS or this Agreement, shall be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or other governing authority. Liability of Company for any breach of the ToS or this Agreement, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the ToS or this Agreement, shall be determined by applicable federal or state law.
    
2.  _Limitation of liability_ - The Parties agree that nothing in the Limitation of Liability clause or elsewhere in the ToS in any way grants Company a waiver from, release of, or limitation of liability pertaining to, any past, current or future violation of federal law.
    
3.  _Governing law and Forum_ - The dispute resolution provision in the ToS is hereby deleted. The ToS and this Amendment shall be governed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with applicable federal laws of the United States of America and exclusive jurisdiction shall be in the appropriate U.S. federal courts. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply in the absence of federal law.
    
4.  _Assignment_ - Neither party may assign its obligations under this Amendment or ToS to any third-party without prior written consent of the other; however, GitHub may, without the Government's consent, assign its obligations to an Government using the service under a free usage plan under this Amendment or ToS to an affiliate or to a successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of GitHub's assets.
    

[F. Changes to this agreement](#f-changes-to-this-agreement)
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  _Precedence; Further Amendment; Termination_ - This Amendment constitutes an amendment to the ToS; language in the ToS indicating it may not be modified or that it alone is the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the ToS, or between this Amendment and other rules or policies on the Company site or services, this Amendment shall prevail. This Amendment may be further amended only upon written agreement executed by both Parties. The Government may close its account and terminate this agreement at any time. Company may close Government's account and terminate this agreement on 30 days written notice, but the Government shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid.
    
2.  _Posting and availability of this Amendment_ - The parties agree this Amendment contains no confidential or proprietary information, and either party may release it to the public at large.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement

_These terms apply to Customers who licensed the Products prior to January 4, 2021. Customers who purchase GitHub Products after that date are directed to [https://github.com/customer-terms](https://github.com/customer-terms) for current terms._

**Short version:** GitHub guarantees a 99.9% quarterly uptime commitment for the applicable GitHub service (the “**Service Level**” or “**SLA**”). If GitHub does not meet the SLA, then Customer will be entitled to a service credit to Customer’s account (“**Service Credits**”).

For definitions of each Service feature (“**Service Feature**”) and to review historical and current Uptime, visit the [GitHub Status Page](https://www.githubstatus.com/). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this SLA have the meaning assigned in Customer’s applicable agreement.

[Uptime Guarantee](#uptime-guarantee)
-------------------------------------

“**Uptime**” is the percentage of total possible minutes the applicable GitHub service was available in a given calendar quarter. GitHub commits to maintain at least 99.9% Uptime for the applicable GitHub service. The Uptime calculation for each Service Feature that may be included with the applicable GitHub service is described below (“**Uptime Calculation**”). If GitHub does not meet the SLA, Customer will be entitled to Service Credits based on the calculation below (“**Service Credits Calculation**”). Note, Downtime does not affect every customer at the same time or in the same way.

**Service Feature**

**Uptime Calculation**

**Definitions**

**Service Credits Calculation**

**Issues**,  
**Pull Requests**,  
**Git Operations**,  
**API Requests (for Service Features only)**,  
**Webhooks**,  
**Pages**

(total minutes in a calendar quarter - Downtime) / total minutes in a calendar quarter

“**Downtime**” is a period of time where either (a) the error rate exceeds five percent (5%) in a given minute for any Service Feature or (b) the Service was unavailable as determined by a combination of GitHub's internal and external monitoring systems.

A Service Credits claim may be based on either (not both) of the following calculations:

*   10% of the amount Customer paid for a Service Feature in a calendar quarter where the Uptime for that Service Feature was less than or equal to 99.9%, but greater than 99.0%.
    
    OR
    
*   25% of the amount Customer paid for a Service Feature in a calendar quarter where the Uptime of that Service Feature was less than 99.0%.

**Actions**

(Total Triggered Executions – Unavailable Executions) / (Total Triggered Executions) x 100

“**Total Triggered Executions**” is the total number of all Actions executions triggered by Customer in a calendar quarter.

“**Unavailable Executions**” is the total number of executions within Total Triggered Executions which failed to run in a calendar quarter. An execution failed to run when the Actions history log did not capture any output five (5) minutes after the trigger was successfully fired.

Same as above

**Packages**

Transfers Uptime = same as Actions

Storage Uptime = 100% - Average Error Rate\*

\*The Uptime Calculation excludes public usage and storage transactions that do not count toward either Total Storage Transactions or Failed Storage Transactions (including pre-authentication failures; authentication failures; attempted transactions for storage accounts over their prescribed quotas).

“**Error Rate**” is the total number of Failed Storage Transactions divided by the Total Storage Transactions during a set time interval (currently set at one hour). If the Total Storage Transactions in a given one-hour interval is zero, the error rate for that interval is 0%.

“**Average Error Rate**” is the sum of Error Rates for each hour in a calendar quarter divided by the total number of hours in a calendar quarter.

Same as above

[Exclusions](#exclusions)
-------------------------

Excluded from the Uptime Calculation are Service Feature failures resulting from (i) Customer’s acts, omissions, or misuse of the applicable GitHub service including violations of the Agreement; (ii) failure of Customer’s internet connectivity; (iii) factors outside GitHub's reasonable control, including force majeure events; or (iv) Customer’s equipment, services, or other technology.

[Service Credits Redemption](#service-credits-redemption)
---------------------------------------------------------

If GitHub does not meet this SLA, Customer may redeem Service Credits only upon written request to GitHub within thirty (30) days of the end of the calendar quarter. Written requests for Service Credits redemption and GitHub Enterprise Cloud custom monthly or quarterly reports should be sent to GitHub using the contact form available at [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/).

Service Credits may take the form of a refund or credit to Customer’s account, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, are limited to a maximum of ninety (90) days of paid service per calendar quarter, require Customer to have paid any outstanding invoices, and expire upon termination of Customer’s agreement with GitHub. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any obligations in this SLA.

## Terms of Service from: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement

[GitHub Privacy Statement](#github-privacy-statement)
-----------------------------------------------------

Effective date: February 1, 2024

Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data”, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the “Data Controller” when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, “Services”). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.

### [End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts](#end-user-notice-organization-provided-github-accounts)

When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:

*   Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.
*   Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.

Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.

In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.

### [Third Party Access and Data Protection](#third-party-access-and-data-protection)

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

[Personal Data We Collect](#personal-data-we-collect)
-----------------------------------------------------

[International data transfers](#international-data-transfers)
-------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under [Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the [European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

[Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](#data-privacy-framework-dpf)
-----------------------------------------------------------

GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### [Dispute resolution process](#dispute-resolution-process)

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.

### [Government Enforcement](#government-enforcement)

GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.

[Our use of cookies and tracking technologies](#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking-technologies)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Cookies and tracking technologies](#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

#### [What are cookies and similar technologies?](#what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### [How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?](#how-do-we-and-our-partners-use-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

Purpose

Description

Required Cookies

GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.

Analytics

We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.

Social Media

GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.

Advertising

In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.

#### [What are your cookie choices and controls?](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls)

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

1.  **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**
    
    Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
    
    Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
    
2.  **Generally for all websites** You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
    

*   If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
*   Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
*   You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
*   Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
*   United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
*   Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
*   Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

[US State Specific Information](#us-state-specific-information)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations.

> \[!NOTE\]
> The GitHub Corporate Terms of Service were deprecated effective 30 November 2021, and are no longer used for new customers. The terms below apply \_only\_ to those GitHub customers with executed agreements that explicitly reference the Corporate Terms of Service. All other business or institution customers are directed to the GitHub Customer Agreement terms available at \[github.com/customer-terms\](https://github.com/customer-terms).

## GitHub Corporate Terms of Service

Version Effective Date: November 16, 2020

This Agreement applies to the following GitHub offerings, as further defined below (collectively, the \*\*“Products”\*\*):
\* The Service;
\* Any Beta Previews;
\* Any related Support; and
\* Any related Professional Services.

## A. Definitions

\*\*“Affiliate”\*\* means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party where "control" means having more than fifty percent (50%) ownership or the right to direct the management of the entity.

\*\*“Agreement”\*\* means, collectively, all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that GitHub may publish from time to time on the Service. GitHub's site policies are available at \[https://docs.github.com/categories/site-policy\](/site-policy).

\*\*“All Users”\*\* means, collectively, Customer’s Users and External Users who use the Service.

\*\*“Americas”\*\* means the United States, Canada, Mexico, or a country in Central or South America or the Caribbean.

\*\*"Beta Previews"\*\* mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.

\*\*"Confidential Information"\*\* means all non-public information disclosed by either Party to the others, whether in writing, orally or by other means, designated as confidential or that the receiving Party knows or reasonably should know, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information, is confidential to the disclosing Party. For the avoidance of doubt, no Content posted on the Service will be considered Confidential Information except for Customer Content stored solely in Customer’s Private Repositories. Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving Party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing Party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing Party; (iv) the receiving Party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's Confidential Information; or (v) is or has been stored or posted on the Service and outside of Customer’s Private Repositories.

\*\*"Content"\*\* means, without limitation, code, text, data, articles, images, packages, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are featured, displayed, or otherwise made available through the Service.

\*\*"Corporate Account"\*\* means an account created by a User on behalf of an entity.

\*\*"Customer"\*\* means the company or organization that has entered into this Agreement with GitHub by clicking on the "I AGREE" or similar button or by accessing the Products.

\*\*"Customer Content"\*\* means Content that Customer creates, owns, or to which Customer holds the rights.

\*\*"Documentation"\*\* means any manuals, documentation and other supporting materials relating to the Products that GitHub provides or makes available to Customer.

\*\*"Effective Date"\*\* is the earlier of the date on which Customer (i) clicks “I agree” to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (ii) first places an order for the Products.

\*\*"External User"\*\* means an individual, not including Customer’s Users, who visit or use the Service.

\*\*"Feedback"\*\* means any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback on GitHub products or services.

\*\*"Fees"\*\* means the fees Customer is required to pay GitHub to (i) use the Products during the applicable Term or (ii) receive Professional Services, as such fees are reflected on an Order Form or SOW.

\*\*“Fork”\*\* means to copy the Content of one repository into another repository.

\*\*“GitHub”\*\* means GitHub, Inc., its Affiliates, and its Representatives.

\*\*"GitHub Content"\*\* means Content that GitHub creates, owns, or to which it holds the rights.

\*\*“Machine Account”\*\* means an account registered by an individual human who accepts the applicable terms of service on behalf of the Machine Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A Machine Account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple Users may direct the actions of a Machine Account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.

\*\*"Order Form"\*\* means written or electronic documentation (including a quote) that the Parties may use to order the Products.

\*\*“Organization”\*\* means a shared workspace that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User can be a member of more than one Organization.

\*\*“Private Repository”\*\* means a repository which allows a User to control access to Content.

\*\*"Professional Services"\*\* means training, consulting, or implementation services that GitHub provides to Customer pursuant to a mutually executed SOW. Professional Services do not include Support.

\*\*“Public Repository”\*\* means a repository whose Content is visible to All Users.

\*\*"Representatives"\*\* means a Party’s employees, officers, agents, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors.

\*\*“Scraping”\*\* means extracting data from the Service via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler, and does not include the collection of information through GitHub's API.

\*\*"Service"\*\* means GitHub's hosted service and any applicable Documentation.

\*\*"SOW"\*\* means a mutually executed statement of work detailing the Professional Services GitHub will perform, any related Fees, and each party's related obligations.

\*\*"Subscription License"\*\* means the license assigned to each User to install, operate, access, and use the Service on Customer’s behalf. Customer may only assign one Subscription License per User across its Organizations. For clarity, once Customer assigns a Subscription License to a User, Customer is prohibited from bifurcating the Subscription License so that one User can use a Subscription License on one Organization while another User uses the same Subscription License on another Organization.

\*\*“Support”\*\* means technical support for the Service that GitHub may provide.

\*\*"User"\*\* means an individual or Machine Account who (a) accesses or uses the Service, (b) accesses or uses any part of Customer’s account; or (c) directs the use of Customer’s account in the performance of functions, in each case on Customer’s behalf. The number of Users should not exceed the number of Subscription Licenses that Customer has purchased.

\*\*“User-Generated Content”\*\* means Content created or owned by a third party or External User.

## B. Account Terms

### 1. Account Controls.

\* \_Users.\_ Customer acknowledges that Users retain ultimate administrative control over their individual accounts and the Content within them. \[GitHub's Standard Terms of Service\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) govern Users' use of the Service, except with respect to Users' activities under this Section B.

\* \_Organizations.\_ Customer retains ultimate administrative control over any Organization created on Customer’s behalf and User-Generated Content posted to the repositories within its Organization(s), subject to this Section B. This Section B will govern the use of Customer’s Organization(s).

### 2. Account Requirements

In order to create an account, Customer must adhere to the following:

\* Customer must not create an account for use of any person under the age of 13. If GitHub learns of any User under the age of 13, it will terminate that User's account immediately. If Customer or its User(s) are located in a country outside the United States, that country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, Customer is responsible for complying with that country's laws.

\*	A User’s login may not be shared by multiple people.

\* Customer must not use the Products (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction; (b) if it is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); or (c) if it is or is working on behalf of a \[Specially Designated National (SDN)\](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions. For more information, please see our \[Export Controls policy\](/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### 3. Account Security

Customer is responsible for: (i) all Content posted and activity that occurs under its Corporate Account; (ii) maintaining the security of its account login credentials; and (iii) \[promptly notifying GitHub\](https://github.com/contact) upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Service through its account. GitHub will not be liable for any loss or damage from Customer’s failure to comply with this Section B.

### 4. Third Party Terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to Customer's use of GitHub. For example, Customer may be a member of an Organization with its own terms or license agreements; Customer may download an application that integrates with the Service; or Customer may use the Service to authenticate to another service. While this Agreement is GitHub’s full agreement with Customer, other parties' terms govern their relationships with Customer.

### 5. U.S. Federal Government Terms

If Customer is a U.S. government entity or otherwise accessing or using the Service in a government capacity, the \[U.S. Federal Government Amendment\](/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies, and Customer agrees to its provisions.

### 6. Enterprise Cloud Service Level Agreement

GitHub’s quarterly uptime commitment for GitHub Enterprise Cloud is provided in the \[Enterprise Service Level Agreement\](/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement). If Customer signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, then Customer will be entitled to a service credit if GitHub does not meet its service level.

## C. Compliance with Laws; Acceptable Use; Privacy

### 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations

Customer’s use of the Products must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or regulations in its jurisdiction.

### 2. Acceptable Use

Customer’s use of the Service must comply with \[GitHub's Acceptable Use Policies\](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) and \[GitHub’s Community Guidelines\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines). Customer must not use the Service in any jurisdiction for unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent Content or activity, such as advocating or causing harm, interfering with or violating the integrity or security of a network or system, evading filters, sending unsolicited, abusive, or deceptive messages, viruses or harmful code, or violating third party rights.

### 3. Privacy

The \[GitHub Privacy Statement\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) and the \[GitHub Data Protection Agreement\](https://github.com/customer-terms) provide detailed notice of GitHub's privacy and data use practices as well as GitHub's processing and security obligations with respect to Customer Personal Data. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from the Service must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of personal data (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If Customer collects any personal information from GitHub, Customer will only use it for the purpose for which the External User has authorized it. Customer will reasonably secure any such Personal Information, and Customer will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or External Users.

## D. Content Responsibility; Ownership; License Rights

### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

Customer may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. Customer is solely responsible for any User-Generated Content that it posts, uploads, links to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that User-Generated Content. GitHub is not responsible for any public display or misuse of User-Generated Content.

### 2. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

Customer retains ownership of Customer Content that Customer creates or owns. Customer acknowledges that it: (a) is responsible for Customer Content, (b) will only submit Customer Content that Customer has the right to post (including third party or User-Generated Content), and (c) Customer will fully comply with any third-party licenses relating to Customer Content that Customer posts.
Customer grants the rights set forth in Sections D.3 through D.6, free of charge and for the purposes identified in those sections until such time as Customer removes Customer Content from GitHub servers, except for Content Customer has posted publicly and that External Users have Forked, in which case the license is perpetual until such time as all Forks of Customer Content have been removed from GitHub servers. If Customer uploads Customer Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions it needs to run the Service, no additional license is required.

### 3. License Grant to Us

Customer grants to GitHub the right to store, archive, parse, and display Customer Content, and make incidental copies, only as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to copy Customer Content to GitHub's database and make backups; display Customer Content to Customer and those to whom Customer chooses to show it; parse Customer Content into a search index or otherwise analyze it on GitHub's servers; share Customer Content with External Users with whom Customer chooses to share it; and perform Customer Content, in case it is something like music or video. These rights apply to both public and Private Repositories. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Customer Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Customer Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Customer Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Customer Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program. Customer grants to GitHub the rights it needs to use Customer Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Customer Content as necessary to provide the Service.

### 4. License Grant to External Users

Any Content that Customer posts publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to External Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting its repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer agree to allow External Users to view and Fork Customer’s repositories.
If Customer sets its pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer grants to External Users a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Customer Content through the Service and to reproduce Customer Content solely on the Service as permitted through functionality provided by GitHub (for example, through Forking). Customer may grant further rights to Customer Content if Customer adopts a license. If Customer is uploading Customer Content that it did not create or own, Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Customer Content it uploads is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to External Users

### 5. Contributions Under Repository License

Whenever Customer adds Content to a repository containing notice of a license, it licenses that Content under the same terms and agrees that it has the right to license that Content under those terms. If Customer has a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

### 6. Moral Rights

Customer retains all moral rights to Customer Content that it uploads, publishes, or submits to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, Customer waives these rights and agrees not to assert them against GitHub, solely to enable GitHub to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D, but not otherwise.

## E. Private Repositories

### 1. Control

Customer is responsible for managing access to its Private Repositories, including invitations, administrative control of Organizations and teams, and of access.

### 2. Confidentiality

GitHub considers Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories to be Customer’s Confidential Information. GitHub will protect and keep strictly confidential the Customer Content of Private Repositories in accordance with Section P.

### 3. Access

GitHub personnel may only access Customer's Private Repositories in the situations described in our \[Privacy Statement\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

Customer may choose to enable additional access to its Private Repositories. For example, Customer may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Customer Content in Private Repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories as Customer’s Confidential Information. If those services or features require rights in addition to those it needs to provide the Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be \[compelled by law\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless \[for legal disclosure\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## F. Intellectual Property Notice

### 1. GitHub's Rights to Content

The look and feel of the Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. Customer may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### 2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos

If Customer would like to use GitHub's trademarks, Customer must follow all of GitHub's trademark guidelines, including those on GitHub's \[logos page\](https://github.com/logos).

### 3. License to GitHub Policies

This Agreement is licensed under the \[Creative Commons Zero license\](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our \[site-policy repository\](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

### 4. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If Customer is a copyright owner and believes that Content on the Service violates Customer’s copyright, Customer may notify GitHub in accordance with GitHub's \[Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy\](/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy) via the \[DMCA form\](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com.

### 5. Intellectual Property Rights Reserved

As between the Parties, GitHub owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products. GitHub reserves all rights in and to the Products not expressly granted to Customer under this Agreement.

## G. GitHub Additional Product Terms

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms as set forth in the \[GitHub Additional Product Terms\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features). By accessing or using these features, Customer agrees to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.

## H. Subscription Licenses

Subscription Licenses are granted on a per User basis and multiple Users may not use the same Subscription License. Customer may reassign a Subscription License to a new User only after ninety (90) days from the last reassignment of that same Subscription License, unless the reassignment is due to (i) permanent hardware failure or loss, (ii) termination of the User’s employment or contract, or (iii) temporary reallocation of Subscription Licenses to cover a User’s absence. When Customer reassigns a Subscription License from one User to another, Customer must block the former User’s access to the Subscription License and Customer’s Organizations.

## I. Affiliates

Customer’s Affiliates are authorized to use the Products in accordance with this Agreement, so long as Customer remains fully responsible for their access and use of the Products.

## J. Payment

### 1. Pricing; Fees

\*\*Payment Terms\*\* Our pricing is available at \[github.com/pricing\](https://github.com/pricing) (unless otherwise negotiated by the parties and stated in an Order Form). Customer agrees to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. Customer must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If Customer fails to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

\*\*Usage-Based Billing\*\* Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to purchase paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears, provided that for invoiced customers, paid Service features are billed in advance. See \[GitHub Additional Product Terms for details\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

### 2. Purchasing Additional Subscription Licenses

Customer may obtain additional Subscription Licenses under this Agreement by submitting a request through the Service or via its sales team. If Customer purchases the additional Subscription Licenses, Customer must pay the then-currently applicable Fees for them, prorated for the balance of the applicable Subscription Term. Upon renewal of Customer’s Subscription Licenses for another Subscription Term, GitHub will invoice all Subscription Licenses at once on an annual basis unless otherwise specified in an Order Form.

### 3. Authorization

Customer authorizes GitHub to charge the on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for Fees.

## K. Term; Termination; Suspension

### 1. Term

This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and will continue in effect until terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section K.

### 2. Termination for Convenience; Account Cancellation

Either Party may terminate an Order Form (if applicable) or this Agreement, without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice. If Customer elects to terminate an Order Form or Agreement, it is Customer's responsibility to properly cancel its account with GitHub by going into Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. GitHub cannot cancel accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### 3. Termination for Material Breach

Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if the other Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives notification. GitHub may terminate this Agreement if Customer's Account has been suspended for more than 90 days.

### 4. Effect of Termination

\* \_Order Forms.\_ Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer may not execute additional Order Forms (if applicable); however, this Agreement will remain in effect for the remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or expires, as to that Order Form: (i) the Term will immediately end; (ii) any Subscription Licenses in the Order Form will automatically terminate, and Customer will no longer have the right to use the Service; (iii) if any Fees were owed prior to termination, Customer must pay those Fees immediately; (iv) each Party will promptly return (or, if the other party requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging to the other to the extent permitted by the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub will make a reasonable effort to provide Customer with a copy of its lawful, non-infringing account Contents upon request; provided that Customer makes this request within 90 days of termination, suspension, or downgrade.

\* GitHub will retain and use Customer's information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce GitHub's agreements, but barring legal requirements, GitHub will delete Customer's full profile and the Content of its repositories within 90 days of termination or expiration (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once Customer's account is canceled.

\* GitHub will not delete Content that Customer has contributed to External Users' repositories or that External Users have forked.

### 5. Suspension

GitHub has the right to suspend access to all or any part of the Service, including removing Content, at any time for violation of this Agreement or to protect the integrity, operability, and security of the Service, effective immediately, with or without notice. Unless prohibited by law or legal process or to prevent imminent harm to the Service or any third party, GitHub typically provides notice in the form of a banner or email on or before such suspension. GitHub will, in its discretion and using good faith, tailor any suspension as needed to preserve the integrity, operability, and security of the Service.

### 6. Survival

All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## L. Communications with GitHub

### 1. Electronic Communication Required

For contractual purposes, Customer (1) consents to receive communications in an electronic form via the email address it submitted or via the Service; and (2) agrees that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that GitHub provides electronically satisfies any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect Customer's non-waivable rights.

### 2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and \[served on GitHub's legal agent\](/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

## M. Limited Warranty; Disclaimer

\_General Warranty\_. Each Party represents and warrants to the other that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement and each Order Form and SOW is entered into by an employee or agent of such Party with all necessary authority to bind such Party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

\_Professional Services Warranty.\_ Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, GitHub warrants that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub's only obligation, and Customer's only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub's option and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this warranty or (ii) if the breach cannot be cured, terminate the SOW and refund the unused prepaid Fees.

\_Service Disclaimer.\_ GitHub provides the Service \*\*“AS IS”\*\* and \*\*“AS AVAILABLE”\*\* without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, GitHub expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet Customer's requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. GitHub will not be responsible for any risk of loss resulting from Customer's downloading and/or use of files, information, Content or other material obtained from the Service.

\_Beta Previews Disclaimer.\_ Customer may choose to use Beta Previews in its sole discretion. Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. Beta Previews may not be as reliable or available as the Service. Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. GitHub will have no liability arising out of or in connection with Beta Previews. \*\*Customer uses Beta Previews at its own risk.\*\*

## N. Limitations of Liability

\*\*\_Indirect Damages.\_ To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will either party be liable to the other party or to any third party for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including for loss of profits, revenue, or data) or for the cost of obtaining substitute products arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, however caused, whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not a party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\*\*

\*\*\_Limitation of Total Liability.\_ To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will either party's total cumulative liability under this Agreement from all causes of action and all theories of liability exceed the Fees Customer has actually paid to GitHub during the 12 months preceding the claim giving rise to such liability. For products and services (including use of the Products) that are provided free of charge, GitHub’s liability is limited to direct damages up to $5,000.00 USD. For Beta Previews, GitHub's liability is limited to direct damages up to $500.00 USD.\*\*

\*\*\_Exclusions.\_ The exclusions and limitations set forth in this Section N will not apply to liability arising out of (1) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations in Section P (except for all liability related to Content (excluding GitHub Content), which will remain subject to the limitations and exclusions above) or (2) a Party’s defense obligations in Section O.\*\*

## O. Defense of Claims; Release

The Parties will defend each other against third-party claims, as and to the extent set forth in this Section O and will pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending Party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement of it. The Party being defended must provide the defending Party with all requested assistance, information, and authority. The defending Party will reimburse the other Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in providing assistance, and will not settle or make any admissions with respect to a third-party claim without the other Party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This Section O describes the Parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims.

### 1. By GitHub

GitHub will defend Customer against any claim brought by an unaffiliated third party to the extent it alleges Customer’s authorized use of the Service infringes a copyright, patent, or trademark or misappropriates a trade secret of an unaffiliated third party. If GitHub is unable to resolve any such claim under commercially reasonable terms, it may, at its option, either: (a) modify, repair, or replace the Service (as applicable); or (b) terminate Customer’s subscription and refund any prepaid, unused subscription fees. GitHub will have no obligation under this Section O.1 for any such claim arising from: i) the modification of the Service, or the combination, operation, or use of the Service with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data, other than as expressly authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation); (ii) Customer’s failure to stop using the Service after receiving notice to do so; (iii) Customer’s obligations under Section O.2; (iv) products or services (including use of the Service) that are provided by GitHub free of charge; or (v) access or use of Beta Previews. For purposes of GitHub’s obligation under this Section O.1, the Service includes open source components incorporated by GitHub therein.

### 2. By Customer

Customer will defend GitHub against any claim brought by an unaffiliated third party arising from: (i) Customer Content that Customer uploads to the Service; (ii) Customer's violation of this Agreement, including Customer’s breach of confidentiality or violation of Section C; or (iii) any third party-branded equipment, devices, software, systems, or data that Customer combines, operates, or uses with the Service.

### 3. Disputes with Other Users

If Customer has a dispute with one or more Users, Customer releases GitHub from all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

## P. Confidentiality

Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its Representatives who (i) have a need to know such information, (ii) are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section P, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and disclosure set forth in this Section P. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, \_provided\_ that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement, unless such notice is prohibited by law. The restrictions set forth in this Section P will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

## Q. Professional Services

Upon Customer’s request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide an SOW detailing such Professional Services. GitHub will perform the Professional Services described in each SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to determine personnel assigned. GitHub may use third parties to perform the Professional Services, provided that GitHub remains responsible for their acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges and agrees that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services, including software, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers anything to Customer while performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with Customer’s use of the Service.

## R. Changes to the Service or Terms

GitHub reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to amend this Agreement at any time and will update this Agreement in the event of any such amendments. GitHub will notify Customer of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on the Service or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, Customer's continued use of the Service constitutes agreement to our revisions of this Agreement. Customer can view all changes to this Agreement in our \[Site Policy\](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

GitHub changes the Service via Updates and addition of new features. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part of it) with or without notice.

## S. Support

GitHub will provide standard technical Support for the Service at no additional charge twenty-four (24) hours per day, five (5) days per week, excluding weekends and national U.S. holidays. Standard Support is only offered via web-based ticketing through GitHub Support, and Support requests must be initiated from a User with which GitHub's Support team can interact. GitHub may provide premium Support (subject to the \[GitHub Premium Support for Enterprise Cloud\](/support/learning-about-github-support/about-github-premium-support) terms) or dedicated technical Support for the Service at the Support level, Fees, and Subscription Term specified in an Order Form or SOW.

## T. Miscellaneous

### 1. Governing Law

If Customer’s principal office is in the Americas, this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of law, any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California, and the Parties hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein. If Customer’s principal office is outside the Americas, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland, any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin, and the Parties hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, GitHub may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.

### 2. Feedback

Customer may provide Feedback to GitHub regarding the Products. Feedback is voluntary and is not Customer Confidential Information, even if designated as such. GitHub may fully exercise and exploit such Feedback for the purpose of (i) improving the operation, functionality and use of GitHub’s existing and future product offerings and commercializing such offerings; and (ii) publishing aggregated statistics about the quality of the Products, provided that no data in any such publication will be used to specifically identify Customer, its employees or Customer’s proprietary software code.

### 3. Non-Assignability

Neither Party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the other Party's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and any attempt to do so will be null and void, except that GitHub may assign this Agreement in its entirety, upon notice to the other party but without the other Party's consent, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the assigning party's business or assets.

### 4. Waiver

A Party's obligations under this Agreement may only be waived in writing signed by an authorized representative of the other Party. No failure or delay by a Party to this Agreement in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right hereunder at law or equity.

### 5. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the Parties will modify or reform this Agreement to give as much effect as possible to that provision. Any provision that cannot be modified or reformed in this way will be deemed deleted and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

### 6. Amendments; Complete Agreement; Order of Precedence

This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by GitHub posting a revised version in accordance with Section R. This Agreement represents the complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between the Parties relating to the subject matter of these terms, including any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any Order Form or SOW, the terms of the Order Form or SOW will control with respect to that Order Form or SOW only.

### 7. Publicity

If Customer publicly displays the name of its company or organization on its account or otherwise publicly display its trademarks or logos on its profile page, Customer allows GitHub to use its company's or organization's name to identify Customer as a GitHub customer in promotional materials. Customer may revoke this permission by hiding its company or organization name from public display and notifying GitHub in writing to stop using its organization's name in promotional materials. However, GitHub will have no obligation to remove or recall any prior use or distribution of the promotional materials.

### 8. Force Majeure

GitHub will be excused from liability to the extent that it is unable to perform any obligation under this Agreement due to extraordinary causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, or power, telecommunication or network failures.

## Terms of Service from: https://github.com/site/privacy

[GitHub Privacy Statement](#github-privacy-statement)
-----------------------------------------------------

Effective date: February 1, 2024

Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data”, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the “Data Controller” when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, “Services”). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.

### [End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts](#end-user-notice-organization-provided-github-accounts)

When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:

*   Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.
*   Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.

Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.

In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.

### [Third Party Access and Data Protection](#third-party-access-and-data-protection)

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

[Personal Data We Collect](#personal-data-we-collect)
-----------------------------------------------------

Personal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties. The Personal Data GitHub processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications), the features you use (such as pull requests, Codespaces, or GitHub Copilot) and your method of accessing the Services (your preferred IDE). Below, we detail the information we collect through each of these channels:

### [From You](#from-you)

*   Account Data: We collect certain information when you open an account such as your GitHub handle, name, email address, password, payment information and transaction information.
*   User Content and Files: When you use our Services, we collect Personal Data included as part of the information you provide such as code, inputs, text, documents, images, or feedback.
*   Demographic information: In some cases, you provide us with ethnicity, gender, or similar demographic details.
*   Feedback Data: This consists of information you submit through surveys, reviews, or interactive features.
*   Payment Information: For paid subscriptions, we collect details like name, billing address, and payment specifics.
*   Profile Information: We collect information to create a user profile, which may include a photo, additional email addresses, job title, or biography.
*   Sales and Marketing Data: This includes information provided for promotional communications, such as name, email address, and company name.
*   Support Data: When you seek customer support, we collect details like code, text, or multimedia files.

### [Automatically](#automatically)

*   Buttons, Tools, and Content from Other Companies: Our Services may contain links or buttons that lead to third-party services like Twitter or LinkedIn. Use of these features may result in data collection. Engaging with these buttons, tools, or content may automatically send certain browser information to these companies. Please review the privacy statements of these companies for more information.
*   Essential Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We use cookies and similar technologies to provide essential functionality like storing settings and recognizing you while using our Services.
*   Non-essential Cookies: Depending on your jurisdiction, we may use online analytics products that use cookies to help us analyze how de-identified users use our Services and to enhance your experience when you use the Services. We may also employ third-party Cookies to gather data for interest-based advertising. In some jurisdictions, we only use non-essential cookies after obtaining your consent. See [this](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls) section for more details and control options.
*   Email Marketing Interactions: Our emails may have web beacons that offer information on your device type, email client, email reception, opens, and link clicks.
*   Geolocation Information: Depending on the Service's functionality, we collect regional geolocation data.
*   Service Usage Information: We collect data about your interactions with the Services, such as IP address, device information, session details, date and time of requests, device type and ID, operating system and application version, information related to your contributions to repositories, and performance of specific features or Services.
*   Website Usage Data: We automatically log data about your Website interactions, including the referring site, date and time of visit, pages viewed, and links clicked.

[International data transfers](#international-data-transfers)
-------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under [Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the [European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

[Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](#data-privacy-framework-dpf)
-----------------------------------------------------------

GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### [Dispute resolution process](#dispute-resolution-process)

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.

### [Government Enforcement](#government-enforcement)

GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.

[Our use of cookies and tracking technologies](#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking-technologies)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Cookies and tracking technologies](#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

#### [What are cookies and similar technologies?](#what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### [How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?](#how-do-we-and-our-partners-use-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

Purpose

Description

Required Cookies

GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.

Analytics

We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.

Social Media

GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.

Advertising

In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.

#### [What are your cookie choices and controls?](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls)

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

1.  **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**
    
    Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
    
    Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
    
2.  **Generally for all websites** You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
    

*   If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
*   Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
*   You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
*   Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
*   United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
*   Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
*   Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

[US State Specific Information](#us-state-specific-information)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”

### [Privacy Rights](#privacy-rights)

Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.
*   Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.
*   Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.

### [Notice of Collection of Personal Information](#notice-of-collection-of-personal-information)

Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data”, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the “Data Controller” when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, “Services”). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.

### [End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts](#end-user-notice-organization-provided-github-accounts)

When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:

*   Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.
*   Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.

Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.

In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.

### [Third Party Access and Data Protection](#third-party-access-and-data-protection)

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

[Personal Data We Collect](#personal-data-we-collect)
-----------------------------------------------------

Personal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties. The Personal Data GitHub processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications), the features you use (such as pull requests, Codespaces, or GitHub Copilot) and your method of accessing the Services (your preferred IDE).

We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

[International data transfers](#international-data-transfers)
-------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under [Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the [European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

[Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](#data-privacy-framework-dpf)
-----------------------------------------------------------

GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### [Dispute resolution process](#dispute-resolution-process)

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo\[at\]github\[dot\]com.

### [Government Enforcement](#government-enforcement)

GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.

[Security and Retention](#security-and-retention)

[Our use of cookies and tracking technologies](#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking-technologies)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Cookies and tracking technologies](#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

#### [What are cookies and similar technologies?](#what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### [How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?](#how-do-we-and-our-partners-use-cookies-and-similar-technologies)

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

Purpose

Description

Required Cookies

GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.

Analytics

We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.

Social Media

GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.

Advertising

In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.

#### [What are your cookie choices and controls?](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls)

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

1.  **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**
    
    Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
    
    Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
    
2.  **Generally for all websites** You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
    

*   If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
*   Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
*   If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
*   You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
*   Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
*   United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
*   Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
*   Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

[US State Specific Information](#us-state-specific-information)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”

### [Privacy Rights](#privacy-rights)

These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:

*   Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we’ve collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information. You can exercise this right by contacting us. You can also access and edit basic account information in your settings.
*   Right to Know Data Recipients: We share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see “Sharing Your Information” below.
*   Right to request Deletion: You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.
*   Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.
*   Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.

### [Notice of Collection of Personal Information](#notice-of-collection-of-personal-information)

Online privacy should be accessible to everyone. It starts with a simpler way to exercise your rights.

![man sitting at a computer](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/img/person-with-computer.svg)

![Turn On GPC placeholder](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/img/turn-on-gpc.svg)

Turn On GPC
-----------

Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.

![Turn On GPC placeholder](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/img/browser-fights-for-you.svg)

Send the Signal
---------------

Your browser will send the GPC signal to websites you visit.

![Turn On GPC placeholder](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/img/live-more-privately.svg)

Exercise Your Rights
--------------------

Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.

![dividing placeholder](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/img/divider-lines.svg)

You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.

Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (GPC), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).

Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the GPC specification. [Get Involved](#contact)

GPC lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
--------------------------------------------------------------

GPC is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

The GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per [CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315](https://www.oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf) for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the GPC signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR Articles 7 & 21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679)). Over time, the GPC signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.

GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders: technologists, web publishers, technology companies, browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and civil rights organizations.

The GPC was initially spearheaded by [Ashkan Soltani](https://twitter.com/ashk4n) [Georgetown Law](https://www.georgetowntech.org/) and [Sebastian Zimmeck](https://twitter.com/SZimmeck) ([Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/)) in collaboration with [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/), [Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)](https://automattic.com/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://spreadprivacy.com/announcing-global-privacy-control/), [Brave](https://brave.com/global-privacy-control/), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/), [Abine](https://joindeleteme.com/blog/how-to-enable-global-privacy-control/), [Digital Content Next (DCN)](https://digitalcontentnext.org/), [Consumer Reports](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/issue/tech-privacy/), and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/).

GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions, listed [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download). If you want to use GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC is available [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference documentation are available [here](https://global-privacy-control.glitch.me/). For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter ([@globablprivctrl](https://twitter.com/globalprivctrl)).

As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please contact us via email at [info\[at\]globalprivacycontrol.org](mailto:info%5Bat%5Dglobalprivacycontrol.org).

GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Privacy Community Group](https://privacycg.github.io/) (Privacy CG) in April 2020. A number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with the proposal [here](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10/).

Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see below).

## GitHub Privacy Statement

Effective date: February 1, 2024

Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data”, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the “Data Controller” when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, “Services”). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.

### End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts

When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:

\* Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.
\* Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.

Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.

In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at \[GitHub Data Protection Agreement\](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.

### Third Party Access and Data Protection

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

## Personal Data We Collect

We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

## International data transfers

GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under \[Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914\](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec\_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the \[European Commission website\](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions\_en).

## Data Privacy Framework (DPF)

GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/>.

GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### Dispute resolution process

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo\[at\]github\[dot\]com.

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit <https://go.adr.org/dpf\_irm.html> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are provided at no cost to you.

An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information visit <https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2>.

### Government Enforcement

GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.

## Security and Retention

GitHub uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We’ll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about \[cookies on GitHub\](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see \[AUTOTITLE\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

#### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

| Purpose | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Required Cookies | GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work. |
| Analytics | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising. |
| Social Media | GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub. |
| Advertising | In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |

#### What are your cookie choices and controls?

  You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

  1. \*\*Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages\*\*

     Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

     Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
  1. \*\*Generally for all websites\*\*
  You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:

\* If your browser sends a \[Do Not Track\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do\_Not\_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
\* Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
\* If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as \[Privacy Badger\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy\_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
\* If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as \[uBlock Origin\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock\_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
\* You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit \[Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy\](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
\* Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
\* United States: \[NAI\](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and \[DAA\](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
\* Canada: \[Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada\](https://youradchoices.ca/)
\* Europe: \[European Digital Advertising Alliance\](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

## The GitHub Terms of Service

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## A. Definitions

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.\_

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at \[github.com/site/privacy\](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at \[docs.github.com/categories/site-policy\](/site-policy).
1. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
1. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
1. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
1. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
1. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See \[Section B(5): Additional Terms\](#5-additional-terms)).
1. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at \[github.com\](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as \[education.github.com\](https://education.github.com/) and \[pages.github.com\](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as \[githubuniverse.com\](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as \[electronjs.org\](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## B. Account Terms

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.\_

### 1. Account Controls

\* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.

\* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### 2. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a \[paid Account\](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### 3. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.
\* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
\* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
\* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
\* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will \[terminate that User’s Account immediately\](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
\* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
\* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a \[Specially Designated National (SDN)\](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our \[Export Controls policy\](/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### 4. Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.
\* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
\* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
\* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the \[GitHub Support portal\](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### 5. Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this \[Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service\](/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the \[Enterprise Cloud Addendum\](/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## C. Acceptable Use

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.\_

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our \[Acceptable Use Policies\](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or \[Community Guidelines\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## D. User-Generated Content

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.\_

### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### 2. GitHub May Remove Content

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or \[GitHub terms or policies\](/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### 4. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the \[GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program\](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### 5. License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you \[adopt a license\](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### 6. Contributions Under Repository License

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### 7. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## E. Private Repositories

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.\_

### 1. Control of Private Repositories

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### 3. Access

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our \[Privacy Statement\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:
\* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be \[compelled by law\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless \[for legal disclosure\](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our \[Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy\](/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via \[our convenient DMCA form\](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing \[copyright@github.com\](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of \[repeat infringers\](/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## G. Intellectual Property Notice

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.\_

### 1. GitHub's Rights to Content

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### 2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.

### 3. License to GitHub Policies

This Agreement is licensed under this \[Creative Commons Zero license\](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our \[site-policy repository\](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## H. API Terms

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.\_

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the \[GitHub Privacy Statement\](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## I. GitHub Additional Product Terms

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.\_

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the \[GitHub Additional Product Terms\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## J. Beta Previews

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.\_

### 1. Subject to Change

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. \*\*By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.\*\*

### 2. Confidentiality

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

\*\*Confidentiality Obligations.\*\* You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

\*\*Exceptions.\*\* Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### 3. Feedback

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## K. Payment

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.\_

### 1. Pricing

Our pricing and payment terms are available at \[github.com/pricing\](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

\* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
\* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
\* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
\* You may change your level of service at any time by \[choosing a plan option\](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your \[Billing settings\](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on \[Cancellation\](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### 3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds

\*\*Payment Based on Plan\*\* For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

\*\*Payment Based on Usage\*\* Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See \[GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details\](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

\*\*Invoicing\*\* For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### 4. Authorization

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### 5. Responsibility for Payment

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the \[GitHub Support portal\](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## L. Cancellation and Termination

\*\*Short version:\*\* \_You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.\_

### 1. Account Cancellation

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can \[cancel your Account at any time\](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### 2. Upon Cancellation

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### 3. GitHub May Terminate
