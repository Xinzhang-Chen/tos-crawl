All content Customer uploads or provides through our Services must be owned or licensed to Customer. Only Customer will have access to such content. One LinkedIn Learning seat = One Customer User, and each seat is deemed used/active when a Customer User registers to access the content service.

During the term of a LinkedIn Campus ordering document, should the Campus Customer exceed the total FTE count listed on the ordering document Customer may increase the FTE count with an executed, zero-dollar add-on ordering document. The add-on seats will co-term with the original order form. If the original ordering document is for a Partial Campus (a specific department on Campus) the additional zero-dollar seats requested must be used for said specific department only. LinkedIn Campus FTE quantities listed on the initial invoice represent the starting quantities that will be provisioned by LinkedIn.

**3.1.1. LinkedIn Learning for Library**

For each LinkedIn Learning for Library seat purchased by Customer, any Customer User who has a valid Customer’s library card, or pin/password, may access the LinkedIn Learning content via LinkedIn Learning for Library during the term of the order.

A Customer User is an individual designated by Customer that has (1) registered, received and maintains an active Customer library card/Customer Account and (2) who resides (maintains a valid address) in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer must verify that the individual resides in the Customer’s geographical service location.

Customer or any government entity related to or associated with Customer will not market to any other groups, including but not limited to, any business, corporation, school district, school (including higher education such as universities or colleges), non-profits, and government agencies. Customer’s breach of the foregoing sentence will be considered a material breach of the Agreement.

**7.3.2.** For transfers of EU Personal Data to Glint for processing by Glint in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 2 of the SCCs for Controller to Processor transfers, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Customer agrees that on the termination of the Services, Glint shall at no cost, and shall cause any subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, unless applicable law prevents Glint from returning or destroying all or part of the data disclosed: (a) return to Customer all the Customer personal data, including survey responses if the User Confidentiality Notice disclosed Customer would receive responses identified to individuals or (b) securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures or (c) export Customer personal data in a non-aggregated form to Customer’s new service provider under a separate written agreement reasonably satisfactory to Glint under which Customer and the recipient of the data accept responsibility and liability for the data subsequent to transfer or export.

LinkedIn reserves the right to limit the number of transfers of each seat. Without limiting any other rights LinkedIn possesses under the Agreement, if LinkedIn discovers that Customer Users are sharing seat access to the Services with other Customer employees or contractors who have not been provisioned access (each, an “**Unauthorized User**”), then LinkedIn will have the right to provision any unused seats purchased by Customer to the Unauthorized Users to remedy Customer’s breach. Customer may not resell, transfer access to, or otherwise monetize the Services without LinkedIn’s written consent.

To ensure members receive high-quality InMail and to help our customers achieve the highest InMail response rates possible, we've established a 13% response rate threshold as part of the Recruiter InMail Policy. This threshold is based on the analysis of InMail activity data as well as member feedback about InMail messages. If you have a response rate of less than 13% over a 14-day period, you’ll receive a warning notification. For any subsequent breach of the 13% threshold, you may be placed in an InMail Improvement Period.

You can learn more about the InMail Improvement Period [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a413271).

**Notes:**

*   An InMail response is defined as any InMail to which the recipient sends an InMail reply, accepts the InMail invitation, or replies as "Not Interested."
    
*   InMail response rates are connected to Recruiter seats. If a seat is transferred, the new seat holder will be accountable for the previous recruiter's response rate.
    
*   Seat holders will receive an InMail credit back for every sent InMail message that receives a response within 90 days of the send date.
    
*   You can learn more about InMail message credits [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a543695).

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy

Effective on June 3, 2022

At LinkedIn, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. 

By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy.

What technologies are used?
---------------------------

Type of technology

Description

Cookies

A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or [tags](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521).

We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels

A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.

Local storage

Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.

Other similar technologies

We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.

Our [cookie tables](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table) lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of our Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time.

What are these technologies used for?
-------------------------------------

Below we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.

Purpose

Description

Authentication

We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.

If you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account.

Security

We use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.

For example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.

Preferences, features and services

We use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our Services more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.

For example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local storage to speed up site functionality.

Customized content

We use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.

For example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional information that relates to your previous search.

Plugins on and off LinkedIn

We use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.

For example, our plugins, including the "Apply with LinkedIn" button or the "Share" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and recognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking "Apply"), the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply.

You can learn more about plugins in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Advertising

Cookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to measure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.

We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s or partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners.

For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see [Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

As noted in [Section 1.4](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#collect) of our Privacy Policy, outside [Designated Countries](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

For further information, please see [Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Analytics and research

Cookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.

We or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service providers, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.

We also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.

If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.

What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.

For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit [LinkedIn’s Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83251).

Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services.

### Your Choices

You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to set cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.

### Opt out of targeted advertising

As described in [Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), you have choices regarding the personalized ads you may see.

LinkedIn Members can adjust their settings [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy).

Visitor controls can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy).

Some mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile advertising IDs for targeted advertising.

### Browser Controls

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.

### What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/copyright-policy

Complaints regarding content posted on the LinkedIn website
-----------------------------------------------------------

LinkedIn respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, LinkedIn provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.

Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, LinkedIn may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that LinkedIn has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.

Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.

Claims regarding copyright infringement
---------------------------------------

### Notice of Copyright Infringement:

Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512), LinkedIn has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed infringements.

    By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  
    
    #### Services
    
    This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.
    
    #### LinkedIn
    
    You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).
    
    We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
    
    If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
    
    If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
    
    As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), our [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) and other documents referenced in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), and updates. You acknowledge and have read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).
    
    ### 1.2 Members and Visitors  
    
    This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.
    
    When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a “Member”. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”
    
    ### 1.3 Changes
    
    We may make changes to this Contract.
    
    We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may [close your account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en). Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
    
2.  2\. Obligations
    ---------------
    
    ### 2.1 Service Eligibility
    
    Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:
    
    You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”
    
    The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
    
    To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the ["Minimum Age"](#key-terms-2) (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
    
    “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6854067)
    
    ### 2.2 Your Account
    
    You will keep your password a secret
    
    You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law.
    
    Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies). [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
    
    As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  
    
    ### 2.3 Payment
    
    You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.
    
    Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively.
    
    If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the [additional terms](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/terms-for-paid-services) specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
    
    *   Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
    *   We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340105)
    *   If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to [cancel or suspend](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) your paid subscription Services.
    *   We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
    *   All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s [refund policy](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5704?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).
    *   We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  
        
    
    You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “[Purchase History](https://www.linkedin.com/payments/purchasehistory)”.  
    
    ### 2.4 Notices and Messages
    
    You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.
    
    You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your [contact information](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/sign-in-and-security) up to date.  
    
    Please review your settings to [control and limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) messages you receive from us.
    
    ### 2.5 Sharing
    
    When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.
    
    Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  
    
    To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
    
3.  3\. Rights and Limits
    ---------------------
    
    ### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
    
    You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.
    
    We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads.
    
    As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original [content](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) that you submit or post to the Services.   
    
    You grant LinkedIn and our [affiliates](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  
    
    A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    
    1.  You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2.  We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your [social actions](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3.  We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/86529?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en)
    4.  While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5.  Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/).  
        
    
    You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.
    
    You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and your choices (including settings).
    
    By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
    
    You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful.
    
    You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
    
    ### 3.2 Service Availability
    
    We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service.
    
    We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
    
    We don’t promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you’ve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
    
    ### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
    
    Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services, is at your own risk.
    
    Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party activities.
    
    Others’ Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/news-mention-broadcast) about this [feature](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).  
    
    Others’ Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using [Services Marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/services) or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   
    
    You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member’s offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   
    
    For [Services Marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/services), (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).   
    
    Others’ Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.
    
    ### 3.4 Limits
    
    We have the right to limit how you connect and interact on our Services.
    
    LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don’ts or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en)).  
    
    We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies) or Dos and Don’ts or otherwise violates this Contract.

    ### 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing
    
    We use data and other information about you to make and order relevant suggestions and to generate content for you and others.
    
    Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339724) 
    
    Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies), including not sharing misleading information.
    
    The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by “AI”, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.

4.  4\. Disclaimer and Limit of Liability
    -------------------------------------
    
    ### 4.1 No Warranty
    
    This is our disclaimer of legal liability for the quality, safety, or reliability of our Services.
    
    LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    
    ### 4.2 Exclusion of Liability
    
    These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you.
    
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
    
    LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO LINKEDIN FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY, OR (B) US $1000.
    
    ### 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions
    
    The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.
    
    THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. A MATERIAL OBLIGATION BEING AN OBLIGATION WHICH FORMS A PREREQUISITE TO OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND ON WHICH YOU MAY REASONABLY RELY, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES WERE DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE BREACH AND WERE FORESEEABLE UPON CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE TYPICAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT.
    
5.  5\. Termination
    ---------------
    
    We can each end this Contract, but some rights and obligations survive.
    
    Both you and LinkedIn may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:
    
    *   Our rights to use and disclose your feedback;
    *   Section 3 (subject to 3.1.1);
    *   Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract; and

    You can visit our [Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) to learn about how to close your account
    
6.  6\. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
    ----------------------------------------
    
    In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section.
    
    If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
    
    If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the [Help Center](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fhelp%2Flinkedin%2Fask%2Fts-adfrf&data=05%7C02%7Cmmills%40linkedin.com%7C48b37c3685a046ad7d8d08dc39876d09%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C638448501200430881%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iSWx0d4TDMTU8%2BzjvQZmuHN1TtGnu0InmBUc3eOgxhs%3D&reserved=0).
    
    For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
    
7.  7\. General Terms
    -----------------
    
    Here are some important details about the Contract.
    
    If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
    
    This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
    
    If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
    
    You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.
    
8.  8\. LinkedIn “Dos and Don’ts”
    -----------------------------
    
    LinkedIn is a community of professionals. This list of “Dos and Don’ts” along with our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies) limits what you can and cannot do on our Services, unless otherwise explicitly permitted by LinkedIn in a separate writing (e.g., through a research agreement).

    ### 1.1 Data You Provide To Us
    
    You provide data to create an account with us.
    
    #### Registration
    
    To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.
    
    You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).
    
    #### Profile
    
    You have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit) about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, [city or area](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/38594?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), endorsements, and optional [verifications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1359065/) of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include [sensitive information](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
    
    You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.

We also use [automated systems](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).

3.  2\. How We Use Your Data
    ------------------------
    
    We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
    
    How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/). We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles [here](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/trust-and-safety/responsible-ai-principles) and learn more about our approach to generative AI [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a5538339?hcppcid=search).

    ### 2.1 Services
    
    Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
    
    We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
    
    #### Stay Connected
    
    Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
    
    We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
    
    It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can [choose](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/connections-visibility) whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
    
    Visitors have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls) about how we use their data.
    
    #### Stay Informed
    
    Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a [social action](#key-terms-2), used a feature, made new connections or were [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    #### Career
    
    Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a [specific task](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fservices&data=05%7C01%7Cssundholm%40linkedin.com%7C7c195d34f8834cc0febd08daf458affa%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638090959000643494%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iBsm49Q3gx81BH3P1%2BaItfXuwKvskXVHMDr0gNAVm1s%3D&reserved=0)) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are [interested](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67405?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
    
    #### Productivity
    
    Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).

    We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing). We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include [TeamLink](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/50216/teamlink-overview) and [LinkedIn Pages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a540854) (e.g., content analytics and followers).

    We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
    
    We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues.

If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-visibility), if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
    
    #### Ad Choices
    
    You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings [can be found here](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). For Visitors, [the setting is here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls).
    
    #### Info to Ad Providers
    
    We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
    
    ### 2.5 Marketing
    
    We promote our Services to you and others.
    
    In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
    
    ### 2.6 Developing Services and Research

    #### Service Development
    
    We use data, including public feedback, to conduct [research](https://engineering.linkedin.com/ab-testing/xlnt-platform-driving-ab-testing-linkedin) and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
    
    #### Other Research
    
    We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these [jobs](https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/february/3/introducing-the-linkedin-workforce-report) and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under [controls](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/economic-graph-research/economic-graph-details#data-privacy) that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to [researchers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6882244) to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
    
    #### Surveys
    
    Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/research-invitations) of survey invitations.

    We use your [data](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/116090) to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/ads-related-actions), for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a711358) or LinkedIn [Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a547077), to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.

4.  3\. How We Share Information
    ----------------------------
    
    ### 3.1 Our Services
    
    Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
    
    #### Profile
    
    Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our [Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their [usage of our Services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
    
    #### Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
    
    Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
    
    *   When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy)). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
    *   In a [group](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/197?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    *   Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
    *   When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
    *   We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/71013?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) where applicable.
    *   Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47992?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6270863) about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
    *   When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
    
    Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
    
    #### Enterprise Accounts
    
    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
    
    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
    
    ### 3.2 Communication Archival
    
    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
    
    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
    
    ### 3.3 Others’ Services
    
    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may [revoke](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/data-sharing-for-permitted-services) the link with such accounts.
    
    The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) [may be available to them on other services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340507/). For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/profile-visibility)), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
    
    ### 3.4 Related Services
    
    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
    
    We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. [Where allowed](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6215608), we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
    
    ### 3.5 Service Providers
    
    We may use others to help us with our Services.
    
    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
    
    ### 3.6 Legal Disclosures
    
    We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
    
    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our [Data Request Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [Transparency Report](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency).
    
    ### 3.7 Change in Control or Sale
    
    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.

    We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have [restricted](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/82934?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) your account for breach of our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en)), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us.

Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

    ### 5.3 Lawful Bases for Processing
    
    We have lawful bases to collect, use and share data about you. You have choices about our use of your data. At any time, you can withdraw consent you have provided by going to settings.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/jobs-policies

_Effective Date January 7, 2025_

Table of Contents

*   [Overview](#overview)
*   [Jobs Review Process](#jobs-review-process)

*   [Requirements](#requirements)
*   [Restrictions](#restrictions)
*   [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)

Overview
--------

All jobs posted on LinkedIn must meet certain quality standards to comply with our policies and remain on the site. These LinkedIn Jobs Policies (“Policies”) will help you determine whether your job post is appropriate for LinkedIn and our job-seeking members. In addition to these Policies, all Jobs must comply with [LinkedIn’s User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement), [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies), your jobs agreement, and all applicable laws.

Jobs Review Process
-------------------

In order to maintain the professionalism and integrity of LinkedIn, new job posts may be reviewed to ensure they don’t violate our Policies. We strive to review jobs as soon as possible and usually do so within one business day. 

If your job post passes review and is approved, you’ll receive an email stating it is active. If your job post violates our Policies, you'll receive an email stating it was closed. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a520650).

What to Do if Your Job is Removed
---------------------------------

If your job is removed, we’ll send you an email explaining why. If you believe your job post was removed in error, you may have the option to appeal the decision within six (6) months of removal. Please note that not all violations are eligible for appeal. Repeated violations of our policies may result in the temporary loss of job posting ability and, in some cases, account restriction. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1358799).

Requirements
------------

**Job posts must be legitimate.** Only create postings for bona fide job opportunities with a reasonable and legitimate intent to hire for the specific position listed. Job posts created primarily for user acquisition (e.g., directing job seekers to sign up for an external platform or service), self-promotion, or purpose other than hiring for a genuine job opportunity are not permitted. Each job post must be for one job opportunity; you cannot solicit general applications for roles at a company. 

**Job posts must be relevant and factual.** All job posts must contain truthful, accurate, and complete information about the jobs they promote. Job posts should clearly state the role, title, responsibilities, qualifications, and job type (e.g., full-time, part-time, contract), as well as whether the opportunity is paid or unpaid. The primary location of the role, along with any relocation and travel requirements and/or conditions, should be plainly visible within the post. 

**Job posts must maintain a high degree of professionalism.** Avoid excessive use of internal jargon, offensive slang, capitalization, or emojis. Job posts containing incomplete sentences, egregious typos, and grammatical errors are subject to removal. 

**Jobs posts and your hiring practices must comply with the law.** Do not create job posts, advertise employment positions, or otherwise engage in recruitment or hiring practices that violate the law in your state or country or the state or country where the job is to be performed. Do not engage in solicitations, communications, or transactions that violate any applicable laws or regulations, including regarding legal eligibility to work. Do not create job posts in the United States without possessing valid Federal or State Employer Identification Numbers, if applicable, or create job posts in any other location in a manner that would not allow compliance with applicable tax and employment laws.

Restrictions
------------

**Discrimination.** LinkedIn prohibits discrimination in job posts based on protected characteristics, including age, gender, gender identity, religion, ethnicity, race, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, and any other basis protected under law. In a jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so, LinkedIn may permit language in posts expressing preference for members of certain groups historically disadvantaged in hiring in that location. LinkedIn may also permit that language when it helps customers comply with local legal requirements in hiring. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1335725).

**Fraud and Deception.** Job posts must not be fraudulent or deceptive. Do not intentionally misrepresent the job, hiring company, or poster. Do not create job posts that require applicants to pay in order to apply or for employment. Failure to clearly disclose in any posting that a position is for an independent contractor or is part-time, piecework, commission-based, or has otherwise nontraditional working conditions or compensation may constitute intentional misrepresentation. 

**MLM and Franchises.** Do not create postings for “business opportunities” that require payments or recruitment of others or that resemble franchises, multi-level marketing, club memberships, or distributorships.

**Malicious Software.** Do not create postings that contain malware, spyware or any other malicious code or otherwise interfere with the operation of the Jobs Services or any device or system or breach or circumvent any security measure of LinkedIn or a third party. 

**Phishing.** Do not use a job posting to promote a website that tricks a user into providing personal or other information.

Miscellaneous
-------------

We reserve the right to reject, approve, or remove any job post for any reason, in our sole discretion, including in response to user feedback. We may suspend or terminate accounts tied to businesses or individuals who repeatedly violate our jobs policies or other terms.  

We periodically update our policies, so please check in and review them regularly. We reserve the right to change our jobs policies at any time without notice.

1.  Introduction
    ------------
    
    ### 1.1 Contract
    
    When you use our Services you agree to all of these terms. Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.
    
    By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  
    
    #### Services
    
    This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.
    
    #### LinkedIn
    
    You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).
    
    We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
    
    If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
    
    If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
    
    As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), our [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) and other documents referenced in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), and updates. You acknowledge and have read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).
    
    ### 1.2 Members and Visitors  
    
    This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.
    
    When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a “Member”. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”
    
    ### 1.3 Changes
    
    We may make changes to this Contract.
    
    We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may [close your account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en). Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
    
2.  2\. Obligations
    ---------------
    
    ### 2.1 Service Eligibility
    
    Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:
    
    You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”
    
    The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
    
    To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the ["Minimum Age"](#key-terms-2) (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
    
    “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6854067)
    
    ### 2.2 Your Account
    
    You will keep your password a secret
    
    You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law.
    
    Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies). [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
    
    As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  
    
    ### 2.3 Payment
    
    You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.
    
    Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively.
    
    If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the [additional terms](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/terms-for-paid-services) specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
    
    *   Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
    *   We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340105)
    *   If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to [cancel or suspend](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) your paid subscription Services.
    *   We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
    *   All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s [refund policy](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5704?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).
    *   We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  
        
    
    You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “[Purchase History](https://www.linkedin.com/payments/purchasehistory)”.  
    
    ### 2.4 Notices and Messages
    
    You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.
    
    You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your [contact information](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/sign-in-and-security) up to date.  
    
    Please review your settings to [control and limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) messages you receive from us.
    
    ### 2.5 Sharing
    
    When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.
    
    Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  
    
    To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
    
3.  3\. Rights and Limits
    ---------------------
    
    ### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
    
    You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.
    
    We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads.
    
    As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original [content](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) that you submit or post to the Services.   
    
    You grant LinkedIn and our [affiliates](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  
    
    A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    
    1.  You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2.  We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your [social actions](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3.  We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/86529?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en)
    4.  While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5.  Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/).  
        
    
    You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.
    
    You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and your choices (including settings).
    
    By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
    
    You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful.
    
    You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
    
    ### 3.2 Service Availability
    
    We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service.
    
    We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
    
    We don’t promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you’ve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
    
    ### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
    
    Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services, is at your own risk.
    
    Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party activities.
    
    Others’ Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/news-mention-broadcast) about this [feature](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).  
    
    Others’ Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using [Services Marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/services) or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   
    
    You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member’s offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   
    
    For [Services Marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/services), (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).   
    
    Others’ Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.
    
    ### 3.4 Limits
    
    We have the right to limit how you connect and interact on our Services.
    
    LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don’ts or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en)).  
    
    We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies) or Dos and Don’ts or otherwise violates this Contract. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342754) about how we moderate content.
    
    ### 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights
    
    We’re providing you notice about our intellectual property rights.
    
    LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. LinkedIn, and “in” logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of LinkedIn.
    
    ### 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing
    
    We use data and other information about you to make and order relevant suggestions and to generate content for you and others.
    
    Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339724) 
    
    Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies), including not sharing misleading information.
    
    The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by “AI”, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.  
    
    #### Affiliates
    
    Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation. 
    
    #### Social Action

    #### Content
    
    Content includes, for example, feed posts, feedback, comments, profiles, articles (and contributions), group posts, job postings, messages (including InMails), videos, photos, audio, and/or PDFs
    
4.  4\. Disclaimer and Limit of Liability
    -------------------------------------
    
    ### 4.1 No Warranty
    
    This is our disclaimer of legal liability for the quality, safety, or reliability of our Services.
    
    LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    
    ### 4.2 Exclusion of Liability
    
    These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you.
    
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
    
    LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO LINKEDIN FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY, OR (B) US $1000.
    
    ### 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions
    
    The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.
    
    THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. A MATERIAL OBLIGATION BEING AN OBLIGATION WHICH FORMS A PREREQUISITE TO OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND ON WHICH YOU MAY REASONABLY RELY, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES WERE DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE BREACH AND WERE FORESEEABLE UPON CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE TYPICAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT.
    
5.  5\. Termination
    ---------------
    
    We can each end this Contract, but some rights and obligations survive.
    
    Both you and LinkedIn may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:
    
    *   Our rights to use and disclose your feedback;
    *   Section 3 (subject to 3.1.1);
    *   Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract; and
    *   Any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination.
    
    You can visit our [Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) to learn about how to close your account
    
6.  6\. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
    ----------------------------------------
    
    In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section.
    
    If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
    
    If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the [Help Center](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fhelp%2Flinkedin%2Fask%2Fts-adfrf&data=05%7C02%7Cmmills%40linkedin.com%7C48b37c3685a046ad7d8d08dc39876d09%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C638448501200430881%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iSWx0d4TDMTU8%2BzjvQZmuHN1TtGnu0InmBUc3eOgxhs%3D&reserved=0).
    
    For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
    
7.  7\. General Terms
    -----------------
    
    Here are some important details about the Contract.
    
    If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
    
    This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
    
    If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
    
    You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.

1.  Introduction
    ------------
    
    ### 1.1 Contract
    
    When you use our Services you agree to all of these terms. Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.
    
    By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  
    
    #### Services
    
    This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.
    
    #### LinkedIn
    
    You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).
    
    We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
    
    If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
    
    If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
    
    As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), our [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) and other documents referenced in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), and updates. You acknowledge and have read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).
    
    ### 1.2 Members and Visitors  
    
    This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.
    
    When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a “Member”. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”
    
    ### 1.3 Changes
    
    We may make changes to this Contract.
    
    We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may [close your account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en). Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
    
2.  2\. Obligations
    ---------------
    
    ### 2.1 Service Eligibility
    
    Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:
    
    You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”
    
    The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
    
    To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the ["Minimum Age"](#key-terms-2) (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
    
    “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6854067)
    
    ### 2.2 Your Account
    
    You will keep your password a secret
    
    You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law.
    
    Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies). [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
    
    As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  
    
    ### 2.3 Payment
    
    You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.
    
    Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively.
    
    If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the [additional terms](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/terms-for-paid-services) specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
    
    *   Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
    *   We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340105)
    *   If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to [cancel or suspend](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) your paid subscription Services.
    *   We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
    *   All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s [refund policy](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5704?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).
    *   We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  
        
    
    You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “[Purchase History](https://www.linkedin.com/payments/purchasehistory)”.  
    
    ### 2.4 Notices and Messages
    
    You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.
    
    You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your [contact information](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/sign-in-and-security) up to date.  
    
    Please review your settings to [control and limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en) messages you receive from us.
    
    ### 2.5 Sharing
    
    When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.
    
    Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  
    
    To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
    
3.  3\. Rights and Limits
    ---------------------
    
    ### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
    
    You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.
    
    We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads.
    
    As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original [content](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) that you submit or post to the Services.   
    
    You grant LinkedIn and our [affiliates](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  
    
    A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    
    1.  You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2.  We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your [social actions](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#key-terms-3) may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3.  We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/86529?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en)
    4.  While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5.  Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/).  
        
    
    You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.
    
    You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and your choices (including settings).
    
    By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
    
    You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful.
    
    You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
    
    ### 3.2 Service Availability
    
    We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service.
    
    We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
    
    We don’t promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you’ve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
    
    ### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
    
    Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services, is at your own risk.
    
    Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party activities.
    
    Others’ Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/news-mention-broadcast) about this [feature](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).  
    
    Others’ Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using [Services Marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/services) or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   
    
    You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member’s offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   
    
    For [Services Marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/services), (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en).   
    
    Others’ Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.
    
    ### 3.4 Limits
    
    We have the right to limit how you connect and interact on our Services.
    
    LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don’ts or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en)).  
    
    We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies) or Dos and Don’ts or otherwise violates this Contract. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342754) about how we moderate content.
    
    ### 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights
    
    We’re providing you notice about our intellectual property rights.
    
    LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners.

    ### 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing
    
    We use data and other information about you to make and order relevant suggestions and to generate content for you and others.
    
    Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339724) 
    
    Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies), including not sharing misleading information.
    
    The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by “AI”, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.

6.  6\. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
    ----------------------------------------
    
    In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section.
    
    If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
    
    If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the [Help Center](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fhelp%2Flinkedin%2Fask%2Fts-adfrf&data=05%7C02%7Cmmills%40linkedin.com%7C48b37c3685a046ad7d8d08dc39876d09%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C638448501200430881%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iSWx0d4TDMTU8%2BzjvQZmuHN1TtGnu0InmBUc3eOgxhs%3D&reserved=0).
    
    For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
    
7.  7\. General Terms
    -----------------
    
    Here are some important details about the Contract.
    
    If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
    
    This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
    
    If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
    
    You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.

3.  2\. How We Use Your Data
    ------------------------
    
    We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
    
    How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/). We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles [here](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/trust-and-safety/responsible-ai-principles) and learn more about our approach to generative AI [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a5538339?hcppcid=search). [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1337820/) about the inferences we may make, including as to [your age and gender](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a517610/) and how we use them.
    
    ### 2.1 Services
    
    Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
    
    We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
    
    #### Stay Connected
    
    Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
    
    We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
    
    It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can [choose](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/connections-visibility) whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
    
    Visitors have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls) about how we use their data.
    
    #### Stay Informed
    
    Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a [social action](#key-terms-2), used a feature, made new connections or were [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    #### Career
    
    Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a [specific task](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fservices&data=05%7C01%7Cssundholm%40linkedin.com%7C7c195d34f8834cc0febd08daf458affa%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638090959000643494%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iBsm49Q3gx81BH3P1%2BaItfXuwKvskXVHMDr0gNAVm1s%3D&reserved=0)) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are [interested](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67405?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
    
    #### Productivity
    
    Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    ### 2.2 Premium Services
    
    Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
    
    We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing). We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include [TeamLink](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/50216/teamlink-overview) and [LinkedIn Pages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a540854) (e.g., content analytics and followers).
    
    ### 2.3 Communications
    
    We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
    
    We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication [preferences](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/messages) at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.
    
    We also enable [communications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/137?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) between you and others through our Services, including for example [invitations](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/115?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), [InMail](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1584?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [messages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1645?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) between connections.
    
    ### 2.4 Advertising
    
    We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
    
    We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
    
    *   Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn [tag](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a427660/) on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
    *   Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
    *   Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
    *   Information from advertising [partners](#key-terms-2), vendors and [publishers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/85809?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en); and
    *   Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member). [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1337820/) about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
    
    [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a426264/) about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our [European Regional Privacy Notice](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy/eu).
    
    We will show you ads called [sponsored content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/39575?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-visibility), if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
    
    #### Ad Choices
    
    You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings [can be found here](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). For Visitors, [the setting is here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls).
    
    #### Info to Ad Providers
    
    We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
    
    ### 2.5 Marketing
    
    We promote our Services to you and others.
    
    In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
    
    ### 2.6 Developing Services and Research
    
    We develop our Services and conduct research
    
    #### Service Development
    
    We use data, including public feedback, to conduct [research](https://engineering.linkedin.com/ab-testing/xlnt-platform-driving-ab-testing-linkedin) and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
    
    #### Other Research
    
    We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these [jobs](https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/february/3/introducing-the-linkedin-workforce-report) and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under [controls](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/economic-graph-research/economic-graph-details#data-privacy) that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to [researchers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6882244) to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
    
    #### Surveys
    
    Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/research-invitations) of survey invitations.
    
    ### 2.7 Customer Support
    
    We use data to help you and fix problems.
    
    We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
    
    ### 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
    
    We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
    
    We use your [data](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/116090) to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/ads-related-actions), for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a711358) or LinkedIn [Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a547077), to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
    
    ### 2.9 Security and Investigations
    
    We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
    
    We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement) and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
    
    #### Social Action
    
    E.g. like, comment, follow, share 
    
    #### Partners
    
    Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 
    
4.  3\. How We Share Information
    ----------------------------
    
    ### 3.1 Our Services
    
    Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
    
    #### Profile
    
    Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our [Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their [usage of our Services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
    
    #### Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
    
    Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
    
    *   When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy)). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
    *   In a [group](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/197?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    *   Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
    *   When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
    *   We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/71013?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) where applicable.
    *   Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47992?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6270863) about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
    *   When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
    
    Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
    
    #### Enterprise Accounts
    
    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
    
    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
    
    ### 3.2 Communication Archival
    
    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
    
    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
    
    ### 3.3 Others’ Services
    
    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may [revoke](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/data-sharing-for-permitted-services) the link with such accounts.
    
    The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) [may be available to them on other services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340507/). For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/profile-visibility)), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
    
    ### 3.4 Related Services
    
    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
    
    We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. [Where allowed](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6215608), we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
    
    ### 3.5 Service Providers
    
    We may use others to help us with our Services.
    
    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
    
    ### 3.6 Legal Disclosures
    
    We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
    
    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our [Data Request Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [Transparency Report](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency).
    
    ### 3.7 Change in Control or Sale
    
    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
    
5.  4\. Your Choices & Obligations
    ------------------------------
    
    ### 4.1 Data Retention
    
    We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
    
    We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.

## Terms of Service from: https://linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy

Effective on June 3, 2022

At LinkedIn, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. 

By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy.

What technologies are used?
---------------------------

Type of technology

Description

Cookies

A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or [tags](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521).

We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels

A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.

Local storage

Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.

Other similar technologies

We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.

Our [cookie tables](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table) lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of our Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time.

What are these technologies used for?
-------------------------------------

Below we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.

Purpose

Description

Authentication

We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.

If you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account.

Security

We use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.

For example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.

Preferences, features and services

We use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our Services more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.

For example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local storage to speed up site functionality.

Customized content

We use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.

For example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional information that relates to your previous search.

Plugins on and off LinkedIn

We use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.

For example, our plugins, including the "Apply with LinkedIn" button or the "Share" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and recognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking "Apply"), the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply.

You can learn more about plugins in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Advertising

Cookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to measure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.

We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s or partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners.

For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see [Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

As noted in [Section 1.4](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#collect) of our Privacy Policy, outside [Designated Countries](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

For further information, please see [Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Analytics and research

Cookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.

We or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service providers, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.

We also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.

If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.

What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.

For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit [LinkedIn’s Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83251).

Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services.

### Your Choices

You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to set cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.

### Opt out of targeted advertising

As described in [Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), you have choices regarding the personalized ads you may see.

LinkedIn Members can adjust their settings [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy).

Visitor controls can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy).

Some mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile advertising IDs for targeted advertising.

### Browser Controls

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.

### What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

LinkedIn respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, LinkedIn provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.

Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, LinkedIn may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that LinkedIn has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.

Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.

We offer a variety of ways for Members and Visitors to control their data.

If you are a Visitor and you would like to contact LinkedIn about processing of your data or exercising the rights outlined in this section, you can reach out using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this [form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO).

Members can also object, correct inaccurate data, delete data, port data and in some cases restrict the use of their data as set out in this section:

#### **Accessing your data**

Members can access and download their data at any time. We will provide your data in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your [Member Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy). You can learn more about how to download your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364?hcppcid=search)

You can edit or correct most of your personal data at any time directly in your account settings. If there is any personal data not listed in your account settings that you would like to correct or update you can [complete a data rectification form.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DRF) You can learn more about how you can change or correct your personal data [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1336621).

If you would like to delete all your personal data from LinkedIn, you can always choose to [close your account.](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/close-accounts)

#### **Restricting the use of your data** 

One of the ways you can restrict how your data is used is in your [Data Privacy settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy) and your [Advertising Data settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). You can also request that processing of your data is restricted if the data is inaccurate or if you believe that the processing is unlawful by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this [form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO).

Where you raise an objection, we will consider your request, our legal obligations, and whether we have a compelling interest in continuing to process your data. In certain cases, consistent with your legal rights and our obligations, we may not be able to fulfil your request—for example, we cannot stop processing your IP address when it is used to authenticate your login details, as this is a security measure that is essential to protect our site. In contrast, you can remove information about your education or work experience from your profile (although as a result, the job recommendations you receive may not be relevant to you) so that we don’t process it. 

Where we use your data for direct marketing (e.g. to send you marketing emails) or profiling for the purposes of direct marketing, you always have the right to object and we will stop using your data for this purpose.

#### **Data Retention**

We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalised or aggregated form.   

You can [delete data from your profile or your activity](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342613) on LinkedIn. If you close your account with LinkedIn, it is closed immediately. However, it may take up to 72 hours for your public profile to be removed from LinkedIn. Search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo! may still display your information temporarily due to the way they collect and update their search data. Learn more about [how your profile shows up in search engine results](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1376045/). Where we share your data with other third parties, as set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), e.g. via the LinkedIn Developer Program, they may retain data in accordance with their own retention policies, or in line with our contractual agreements with them.   

For data that LinkedIn collects using cookies, you can see how long LinkedIn processes it for by checking the expiration periods in our [Cookie table](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table). LinkedIn may also collect information about you from cookies on third party websites. For data collected from third party websites where a LinkedIn customer has installed LinkedIn’s tag, LinkedIn de-identifies your personal data after 7 days and permanently deletes it after 180 days.  

There are a number of reasons why we might need to retain some of your data for longer than usual. These may include:

*   Where LinkedIn has suspended your account for inappropriate, harmful or illegal activity that breaches our Professional Community Guidelines and/or we need to resolve complaints relating to your account.
*   Where there is ongoing or potential legal or regulatory proceedings related to your account.
*   Where we are required by law to retain your data. For more information on when we may be required to retain your data for these purposes, see the “**Compliance with Legal Obligations**” section above.  
    

#### **Transfers of your data outside the Designated Countries and the UK** 

LinkedIn may transfer personal data outside of the Designated Countries and the UK as part of its Services e.g. LinkedIn stores personal data on its servers located in the US, so data flows from the EU, EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US, and back. LinkedIn will always use a lawful transfer mechanism to transfer your data outside of the Designated Countries including transfers based on an adequacy decision by an approved authority, standard contractual clauses or, where appropriate, derogations permitted by law.   

LinkedIn is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and you can find out more information about our participation in the Data Privacy Framework [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1343190).  

LinkedIn also relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of certain personal data from the EU/EEA and Switzerland and on the UK Data Transfer Addendum for certain transfers from the UK. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies (e.g. between LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company and LinkedIn Corporation or suppliers). You can request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual clauses [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/ppq).

### 2.3 Your Right to Opt Out of Sharing

Under the CCPA, you can opt out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. You can direct us not to share your personal information as described in Section 1.

### 2.4 Your Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information

Under the CCPA, you can limit a business’s use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to certain purposes specified by law (e.g., providing you with services you request or preventing fraud, or for other purposes that don’t involve deriving your attributes). We only use sensitive personal information for such permitted purposes, so we don’t have an opt-out.

### 2.5 Your Right to Notification

Under the CCPA, a business like LinkedIn cannot collect new categories of personal information or use them for materially different purposes without first notifying you.

### 2.6 Nondiscrimination for Exercising Your CCPA Rights

The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or quality of services, or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services as a result of exercising your rights.

### 2.7 Your Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information

Like all of our members, you can edit much of your personal information through your LinkedIn account (such as your profile information). You can also [request that we correct inaccurate personal information](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/93560).

### 2.8 Your Right to Delete Personal Information

Like all of our members, you can request that we delete your personal information [by closing your LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63) or by requesting that we [delete specific information](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/93500) about you. We honor such requests unless an exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete the transaction or contract for which it was collected or when information is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, comply with laws, identify and repair bugs, or ensure another consumer’s ability to exercise their free speech rights or other rights provided by law.

### 2.9 LinkedIn Annual CCPA Metrics

Please visit [LinkedIn's CCPA Annual Metrics page](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/california-privacy-disclosure-annual-metrics) to view metrics required by CCPA regulations for the past calendar year.

### 2.10 Statement Regarding Selling or Sharing the Personal Information of Consumers Under Age 16

CCPA regulations require us to state whether we have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. As stated in our [user agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement), LinkedIn services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly provide services to anyone under the age of 16 nor do we have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy/usa

Several U.S. states have enacted privacy laws to grant new privacy rights to their residents. These laws include the **[California Consumer Privacy Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)** (as modified by the **[California Privacy Rights Act](https://cppa.ca.gov/faq.html)**) (CCPA) and comprehensive consumer privacy laws enacted in **[Virginia](https://www.oag.state.va.us/consumer-protection/files/tips-and-info/Virginia-Consumer-Data-Protection-Act-Summary-2-2-23.pdf)**, **[Colorado](https://coag.gov/resources/colorado-privacy-act/)**, **[Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/ag/sections/privacy/the-connecticut-data-privacy-act)**, **[Utah](https://dcp.utah.gov/ucpa/)**, **[Oregon](https://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer-protection/id-theft-data-breaches/privacy/)**, **[Texas](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-privacy-rights/texas-data-privacy-and-security-act)**, Florida, Montana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Delaware, and New Jersey, among others.

Depending on the state, these laws, as applicable, provide individuals with rights to:

*   Access their information 
*   Correct their inaccurate information 
*   Opt out if a business “sells” their information, uses or shares it for certain advertising purposes, or profiles them to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects 
*   Be notified about a business’s data practices
*   Nondiscrimination for exercising their privacy rights 
*   Delete their personal information 
*   Appeal if a business refuses to delete, correct, or provide their information (if LinkedIn denies such a request, you will be able to appeal by responding to the message we send to inform you of our decision)

The goals and key requirements of these laws are consistent with LinkedIn's longstanding commitment to data protection and transparency. This commitment is reflected in our focus on building privacy into our products, providing our members with control over their data and being transparent about how we use member data. Our **[Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?src=or-search&veh=www.google.com%7Cor-search)** contains more information about the types of information we collect, how we use it, the circumstances under which we share it with others, how you can exercise your rights, and how to contact us. You can learn more about how we comply with the CCPA in our **[California Consumer Privacy Act Notice](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/california-privacy-disclosure?src=or-search&veh=www.google.com%7Cor-search)**, which supplements our **[Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?src=or-search&veh=www.google.com%7Cor-search)**. For purposes of the Colorado Privacy Act and the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, we do not sell your data, engage in targeted advertising (i.e. select ads based on activities outside our own websites or applications), or profile you to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects. However, we offer members many **[choices](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads?src=or-search&veh=www.google.com%7Cor-search)** to control their experience with ads. You may also find additional useful information on managing your LinkedIn profile in our **[Privacy FAQs](https://privacy.linkedin.com/faq)**.

### Commitment regarding deidentified data

Under some laws, “deidentified” information is not considered personal information where a company commits that it will not attempt to reidentify it. Where we process information that we regard as deidentified, we will maintain and use it in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify it.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1341216/updates-to-user-agreement-and-privacy-policy

These documents were updated on January 6, 2020, with minor revisions on August 11, 2020, including the [removal of references to the](https://news.linkedin.com/2020/august/digital-library-leader-scribd-is-acquiring-slideshare) **[SlideShare](https://news.linkedin.com/2020/august/digital-library-leader-scribd-is-acquiring-slideshare)** business which we no longer operate; on February 1, 2022, to clarify how and where we will resolve any disputes that may arise with our members; on March 6, 2024, to provide more detail on the information submitted to create an account; and on July 31, 2024, to provide additional examples to illustrate the data sharing in Section 3 and to add hyperlinks to existing resources for how our users can exercise their rights. On September 18, 2024, we added examples and other details to our Privacy Policy to clarify how we use personal data to develop and provide AI-powered services and share data with our affiliates, and to provide additional links to information that may be relevant to individuals in certain regions, and on November 20, 2024, we updated our User Agreement, including adding details on our generative AI features and how we recommend and moderate content and updating our license.

We understand that our success in achieving our mission of connecting the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful is based on the trust our users have placed in LinkedIn. We strive to foster this trust by being open and transparent. We encourage users to read the revised [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/static?key=user_agreement) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/static?key=privacy_policy).

### Quickly close your account

We'll be sorry to see you go. Closing your account will delete any recommendations or endorsements you've given or received, plus your messages and connections.

Closing your account means permanently deleting your profile and removing access to all your LinkedIn information from our site. If you have a Premium account, you can [cancel the Premium access](https://linkedin.com/premium/cancel), but still keep your free Basic account to retain your profile, connections, and other information.

### Important to know

If you have an Enterprise account and cancel it, you will lose access to your Online Jobs and those you have posted in Recruiter. However, the Recruiter data remains the same and you can reassign your Recruiter license to another user. (See **Related task** section below.)

To close your LinkedIn account from the [Settings & Privacy](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/account-preferences) page:

1.  Click the
    
    **Me** icon at top of your LinkedIn homepage.

*   Your profile will no longer be visible on LinkedIn.
    
*   Search engines like Yahoo!, Bing, and Google may still display your information temporarily due to the way they collect and update their search data. Learn more about [how your profile shows up in search engine results](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/54).
    
*   You'll lose all recommendations and endorsements you've collected on your LinkedIn profile.
    
*   You may want to [download a copy of your data](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191) before you close your account with us.
    
*   If you have a premium membership, own a LinkedIn group, or have a premium account license, you'll have to resolve those accounts before being able to close your Basic account.
    
*   If you've created more than one account, learn how to [delete or merge a duplicate account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1275).
    
*   Your purchase history will no longer be accessible.
    

You can [reopen your account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/3222) in most cases if it's been closed less than 14 days, but we're unable to recover the following even if you reopen your account:

*   Endorsements and recommendations
    
*   Ignored or pending invitations
    
*   Followings (Top Voices, Companies, etc.)
    
*   Group memberships
    

**Do you want to keep your account but receive fewer emails and notifications?**

You can set the frequency of email communications and notifications from the [Notifications](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/communications) section of your [Settings & Privacy](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) page to reduce emails, notifications, group digest emails, and LinkedIn announcements. On the mobile app, the **Settings** page is located at the top right corner of your profile page.

Learn more about [managing the types and frequency of email from LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67).

**Did you sign up using 3rd party credentials (such as Google, Apple, Facebook, or Microsoft)?** 

If you signed up for LinkedIn using login credentials from a third party email provider (such as Gmail, Facebook, or Apple), please be sure to unlink that email account from LinkedIn via the third party’s site. To learn how, visit their help centers such as the [Google Help Center](https://support.google.com/?sjid=15291473502702677720-NA&visit_id=638519903312787775-1386784282&rd=1) or [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).

Currently, members have the option to schedule cancelation for the next billing date. If you require immediate cancelation of your Premium subscription, please contact LinkedIn customer support. 

**Note for Apple users:** LinkedIn Premium subscription purchased on an Apple device via Apple Store can be cancelled using the LinkedIn mobile app on an Apple device.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5704?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en

### Refund Request

Submit a refund request if you believe you are eligible for a refund.

**Premium subscriptions**

LinkedIn Premium subscriptions, such as Premium Career, Premium Business, Premium Company Page, LinkedIn Learning, Recruiter Lite, and Sales Navigator may be refundable within 7 days from the date the subscription is charged without premium usage. If you cancel your Premium subscription, all your Premium features, including InMail messages, will expire at the end of your billing cycle.

**Notes**:

*   If your subscription was purchased via the LinkedIn iOS app, please [Contact Apple](https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=kbase&PGF=PGF63006&category_id=SC0060&symptom_id=23208) to inquire about cancellations and refunds. All iOS refunds must be issued by Apple. You’ll need to click the No Thanks, Continue button to connect with an Apple support rep via email or chat.

**Pay-per-action products**

﻿Pay-per-action products charge per click, impression, applicant, etc. These products include, for example, LinkedIn Ads, Sponsored Jobs, and any other product where you're charged per action. Any actions delivered and charged are non-refundable.

Under the laws applicable in your jurisdiction, you may qualify for a refund. For example, if you’re using our services for yourself (instead of on behalf of a business):

*   If you live in Denmark or the Netherlands, we'll cancel your subscription with a one-month notice and refund any part of your subscription period remaining.
    
*   Citizens of the European Union are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins. 
    
    **Note**: This 14-day period begins when the subscription service starts. For example, if you signed up for a one-month free trial, the period begins on the first day of your free trial, so there will be no fees paid as a refund.
    
*   If you live in Germany, we'll cancel your subscription with a one-month notice and refund any part of your subscription period remaining (excluding the first year of an annual subscription).
    
*   If you made a purchase using Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) direct debit, you're entitled to a refund from your bank under the terms and conditions of your agreement with your bank. A SEPA direct debit refund must be claimed within eight weeks starting from the date on which your account was debited.
    
*   If you believe your situation warrants an exception, you can submit your account for review.

When our algorithm identifies a news story that mentions you, you'll receive a **You Made the News** email. This email includes the news stories about you that are shared with your LinkedIn connections and followers, should your privacy settings allow such sharing. If there's an article that's incorrectly associated with you or that you'd like to remove, click **Remove Article**. If you'd like to share a news article that mentions you more widely, click **Share**.

We can't guarantee that every article about you or a person or organization you follow is picked up. This could be because the name is too common for our system to be confident in the match, the article content is considered objectionable, or the publication (i.e. New York Times) doesn't allow us to pull articles from its site, among other reasons.

If you don't want your connections and followers to know when you're mentioned in the news, you can opt out of this feature in your [privacy settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/). Please note that this option is not available to organizations, and generally we are not able to remove accurate associations to companies or other organizations upon request.

2.  1\. Data We Collect
    -------------------
    
    ### 1.1 Data You Provide To Us
    
    You provide data to create an account with us.
    
    #### Registration
    
    To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.
    
    You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).
    
    #### Profile
    
    You have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit) about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, [city or area](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/38594?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), endorsements, and optional [verifications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1359065/) of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include [sensitive information](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
    
    You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.
    
    #### Posting and Uploading
    
    We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services.
    
    If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.
    
    You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.

    Others may post or write about you.
    
    #### Content and News

We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of [mentions in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    Others may sync their calendar with our Services
    
    #### Contact and Calendar Information
    
    We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests).

    #### Related Companies and Other Services
    
    We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our [Affiliates](#key-terms-1), including Microsoft.

We use log-ins, cookies, [device information](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#your_device_and_location) and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use.
    
    ### 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies
    
    We collect data through cookies and similar technologies.
    
    As further described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy), we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111735). You can [opt out](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.

This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use [automated systems](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    ### 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information
    
    When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
    
    Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “[LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a540854/?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en)” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

    ### 1.9 Other
    
    We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.
    
    Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

    Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.
    
3.  2\. How We Use Your Data
    ------------------------
    
    We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
    
    How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/). We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles [here](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/trust-and-safety/responsible-ai-principles) and learn more about our approach to generative AI [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a5538339?hcppcid=search). [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1337820/) about the inferences we may make, including as to [your age and gender](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a517610/) and how we use them.
    
    ### 2.1 Services
    
    Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
    
    We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
    
    #### Stay Connected
    
    Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
    
    We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
    
    It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can [choose](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/connections-visibility) whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
    
    Visitors have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls) about how we use their data.
    
    #### Stay Informed
    
    Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a [social action](#key-terms-2), used a feature, made new connections or were [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    #### Career
    
    Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a [specific task](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fservices&data=05%7C01%7Cssundholm%40linkedin.com%7C7c195d34f8834cc0febd08daf458affa%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638090959000643494%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iBsm49Q3gx81BH3P1%2BaItfXuwKvskXVHMDr0gNAVm1s%3D&reserved=0)) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are [interested](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67405?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
    
    #### Productivity
    
    Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    ### 2.2 Premium Services
    
    Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
    
    We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing). We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include [TeamLink](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/50216/teamlink-overview) and [LinkedIn Pages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a540854) (e.g., content analytics and followers).
    
    ### 2.3 Communications
    
    We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
    
    We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication [preferences](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/messages) at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.
    
    We also enable [communications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/137?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) between you and others through our Services, including for example [invitations](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/115?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), [InMail](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1584?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [messages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1645?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) between connections.
    
    ### 2.4 Advertising
    
    We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
    
    We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
    
    *   Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn [tag](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a427660/) on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
    *   Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
    *   Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
    *   Information from advertising [partners](#key-terms-2), vendors and [publishers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/85809?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en); and
    *   Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member). [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1337820/) about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
    
    [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a426264/) about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our [European Regional Privacy Notice](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy/eu).
    
    We will show you ads called [sponsored content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/39575?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-visibility), if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
    
    #### Ad Choices
    
    You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings [can be found here](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). For Visitors, [the setting is here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls).
    
    #### Info to Ad Providers
    
    We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
    
    ### 2.5 Marketing
    
    We promote our Services to you and others.
    
    In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
    
    ### 2.6 Developing Services and Research
    
    We develop our Services and conduct research
    
    #### Service Development
    
    We use data, including public feedback, to conduct [research](https://engineering.linkedin.com/ab-testing/xlnt-platform-driving-ab-testing-linkedin) and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
    
    #### Other Research
    
    We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these [jobs](https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/february/3/introducing-the-linkedin-workforce-report) and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under [controls](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/economic-graph-research/economic-graph-details#data-privacy) that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to [researchers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6882244) to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
    
    #### Surveys
    
    Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/research-invitations) of survey invitations.
    
    ### 2.7 Customer Support
    
    We use data to help you and fix problems.
    
    We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
    
    ### 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
    
    We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
    
    We use your [data](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/116090) to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/ads-related-actions), for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a711358) or LinkedIn [Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a547077), to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
    
    ### 2.9 Security and Investigations
    
    We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
    
    We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement) and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
    
    #### Social Action
    
    E.g. like, comment, follow, share 
    
    #### Partners
    
    Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 
    
4.  3\. How We Share Information
    ----------------------------
    
    ### 3.1 Our Services
    
    Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
    
    #### Profile
    
    Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our [Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their [usage of our Services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
    
    #### Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
    
    Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
    
    *   When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy)). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
    *   In a [group](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/197?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    *   Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
    *   When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
    *   We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/71013?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) where applicable.
    *   Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47992?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6270863) about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
    *   When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
    
    Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
    
    #### Enterprise Accounts
    
    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
    
    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
    
    ### 3.2 Communication Archival
    
    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
    
    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
    
    ### 3.3 Others’ Services
    
    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may [revoke](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/data-sharing-for-permitted-services) the link with such accounts.
    
    The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) [may be available to them on other services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340507/). For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/profile-visibility)), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
    
    ### 3.4 Related Services
    
    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
    
    We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. [Where allowed](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6215608), we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
    
    ### 3.5 Service Providers
    
    We may use others to help us with our Services.
    
    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
    
    ### 3.6 Legal Disclosures
    
    We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
    
    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our [Data Request Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [Transparency Report](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency).
    
    ### 3.7 Change in Control or Sale
    
    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
    
5.  4\. Your Choices & Obligations

    ### 4.1 Data Retention
    
    We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
    
    We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
    
    ### 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

    If you choose to close your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours.

    We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have [restricted](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/82934?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) your account for breach of our [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en)), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
    
    Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

    ### 5.3 Lawful Bases for Processing
    
    We have lawful bases to collect, use and share data about you. You have choices about our use of your data. At any time, you can withdraw consent you have provided by going to settings.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=content_footer-cookie-policy

Effective on June 3, 2022

At LinkedIn, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. 

By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy.

What technologies are used?
---------------------------

Type of technology

Description

Cookies

A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or [tags](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521).

We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels

A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.

Local storage

Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.

Other similar technologies

We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.

Our [cookie tables](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table) lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of our Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time.

What are these technologies used for?
-------------------------------------

Below we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.

Purpose

Description

Authentication

We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.

If you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account.

Security

We use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.

For example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.

Preferences, features and services

We use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our Services more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.

For example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local storage to speed up site functionality.

Customized content

We use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.

For example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional information that relates to your previous search.

Plugins on and off LinkedIn

We use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.

For example, our plugins, including the "Apply with LinkedIn" button or the "Share" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and recognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking "Apply"), the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply.

You can learn more about plugins in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Advertising

Cookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to measure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.

We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s or partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners.

For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see [Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

As noted in [Section 1.4](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#collect) of our Privacy Policy, outside [Designated Countries](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

For further information, please see [Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Analytics and research

Cookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.

We or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service providers, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.

We also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.

If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.

What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.

For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit [LinkedIn’s Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83251).

Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services.

### Your Choices

You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to set cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.

### Opt out of targeted advertising

As described in [Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), you have choices regarding the personalized ads you may see.

LinkedIn Members can adjust their settings [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy).

Visitor controls can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy).

Some mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile advertising IDs for targeted advertising.

### Browser Controls

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.

### What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

Complaints regarding content posted on the LinkedIn website
-----------------------------------------------------------

LinkedIn respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, LinkedIn provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.

Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, LinkedIn may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that LinkedIn has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.

Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.

## Terms of Service from: https://brand.linkedin.com/policies?trk=content_footer-brand-policy

If you're looking to talk about LinkedIn for your business, or use LinkedIn branding, here's a helpful guide to show you how.

**Guidance**
------------

LinkedIn is the owner of the LinkedIn trademark and the \*\[in\] Logo (as well as other trademarks, collectively our “Brand”), and protecting our intellectual property is very important to us. A list of our trademarks can be found [here](https://brand.linkedin.com/trademarks). Since LinkedIn is the owner of the Brand, please do not file any applications with any intellectual property office for any marks which incorporate the Brand.

Our Brand may only be used as outlined in these guidelines or with express written permission from an authorized representative of LinkedIn. We may request that you stop the use of our Brand if we believe, in our sole discretion, that your use of our Brand violates our Branding Guidelines, our [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?src=direct%2Fnone&veh=direct%2Fnone&trk=content_footer-brand-policy), or our [Professional Community Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies?src=direct%2Fnone&veh=direct%2Fnone&trk=content_footer-brand-policy), hereafter collectively referred to as “LinkedIn Brand and User Agreements.”

Your use must also be consistent with applicable law and align with LinkedIn’s values (which include, but are not limited to, not using the Brand in a misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable manner).  Failure to follow these guidelines could result in the suspension or termination of your LinkedIn account and other actions by LinkedIn. We may modify these Guidelines at any time, and your continued use of the Brand Features will constitute your consent to such modifications.

Overall, you should ensure that you do not use our Brand in a manner that might create the impression that your use is sponsored by LinkedIn. Please ensure compliance with these guidelines, make clear that your use is separate from the LinkedIn Brand, and ensure that you do not copy or imitate the LinkedIn platform’s overall look and feel. Any logos or images found elsewhere on the web are not approved for use. Please help us protect our Brand, and present your work in the most appropriate way, by following these guidelines and only using approved Brand assets from this site.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/lmsprogramterms

**IF YOU ARE A US-BASED ADVERTISER, PLEASE READ THE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER LOCATED IN SECTION 7. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND LINKEDIN ARE RESOLVED.**

**1\. APPLICABLE TERMS**. Your participation in the LinkedIn Marketing Solutions advertising program (“**Program**”), which includes the advertising auction and products described below, is subject to (I) these LinkedIn Marketing Solutions Program Terms (these “**Terms**”), and (II) either the

(a) IAB/AAAA Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys 1 year or less version 3.0 (“IAB Standard Terms”), with the governing law and venue clauses in Section XIV(d) replaced with (i) Santa Clara County, California, USA if the Insertion Order is signed by LinkedIn Corporation, (ii) Dublin, Ireland, if the Insertion Order is signed by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, (iii) Singapore, if the Insertion Order is signed by LinkedIn Singapore Pte Ltd; or (iv) the People’s Republic of China, if the Insertion Order is signed by Beijing Lingyin Information Technology Co., Ltd, or

(b) if an advertising agreement exists or is executed between the parties, then the advertising agreement and not the IAB Standard Terms (whichever is applicable, collectively referred to here as the “**Advertising Agreement**”).

**For U.S.-based customers only**: If your participation in the Program is governed by the IAB Standard Terms and if any issue or dispute arises under these Terms, then any action or proceeding arising from such issue or dispute will be brought in compliance with Section 7 of this Agreement. However, if Section 7 is not applicable or enforced as to a particular claim or dispute, any action or proceeding will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, pursuant to Section 1(II)(i) above.

By participating in the Program or Auction (as defined in Section 2 below), you agree to be bound by these Terms and the applicable Advertising Agreement. If you do not accept these Terms in their entirety, you must not access or use the Program or Auction.

If there is any conflict between the terms of an Insertion Order (“IO”), the Advertising Agreement, and these Terms, these Terms will prevail, followed by the IO, and lastly the Advertising Agreement. LinkedIn may, in its sole discretion, modify these Terms at any time (e.g., to launch a new ad product). Your continued participation in the Program after any changes to the Terms means that you accept the changes. The Program and your participation in it is also subject to cancellation or termination at any time (including in instances in which you do not meet LinkedIn’s credit approval requirements).

**2\. LINKEDIN MARKETING SOLUTIONS PROGRAM.** The Program offers you the ability to choose from various types of native LinkedIn advertising [products](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/success/ads-guide) (“**Advertising Products**”) to help you reach certain professional audiences on LinkedIn and beyond. The cost of ads is determined by an online auction system (“**Auction**”) that allows you to place bids for your desired Advertising Products to win placement on properties of LinkedIn and also enabled third parties (collectively, “**Properties**”), e.g., LinkedIn Audience Network websites and mobile applications. All advertisers who want to reach a similar target audience (including in some instances, LinkedIn and its affiliates, who participate to promote its own products or services) will place their respective bids in the Auction. The available bid types are described [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/1392), each of which is aligned to your chosen ad objective and ad type. The advertiser whose bid wins the Auction will have its ad creatives served to that particular audience. The Program offers additional optional features that you can choose to use in connection with your Advertising Products campaigns. LinkedIn may also periodically run tests or trials through its Properties. These or other service modifications may affect your use of the Properties, including their respective pricing or performance.

If you are accessing or using the Program or Auction on behalf of a business or third party, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and to bind that business or third party to the Terms and the Advertising Agreement, and your agreement to the Terms and the Advertising Agreement will be treated as their respective agreement.

**2.1 Advertising Product Types**. LinkedIn offers several types of ads:

**a. Sponsored Content.** Sponsored Content is a promoted post from an advertiser that appears in members’ LinkedIn feed and beyond. It may feature text, an image, a video, or a single job posting and links to a related website of the advertiser’s choice. LinkedIn may also deliver your Sponsored Content on network properties beyond the LinkedIn.com site to reach your specified audience, unless you opt-out of the LinkedIn Audience Network as described [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/61029). As provided in LinkedIn’s Privacy Policy, LinkedIn may use device identifiers obtained on and off the LinkedIn.com site for its advertising services, including to determine which devices LinkedIn members may use and serve advertisements to them on their different devices. LinkedIn and Advertiser will each prominently post a complete and accurate privacy policy on our respective websites and mobile applications, including information regarding cross-device tracking and advertising targeting.

**b. Sponsored Messaging.** Sponsored Messaging includes both message ads and conversation ads, which are native ads displayed in members’ LinkedIn Messaging.

**c. Dynamic Ads**. Dynamic ads are personalized ads tailored to each user based on their LinkedIn profile data. These ads support all levels of full funnel marketing and can be used with a variety of objective-based advertising options, including brand awareness, website visits and engagement.

**d. Text Ads.** Text Ads appear in the right rail or the top banner of many pages on LinkedIn. These ads may feature text only or may also include an image, such as the advertising company’s logo.

**e. Pipeline Builder.** You will use Pipeline Builder and information about LinkedIn members only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of an advertiser and/or its affiliates.

LinkedIn does not allow third-party impression tracking unless it has the technical capability to support such trackers for the specific ad type. 

**2.2 Campaign Management.** You will be responsible for all campaign management and Auction bidding through the Campaign Manager tool, which includes: creating the targeting, setting bids, bid cost basis, increasing or decreasing bids, specifying daily and/or maximum budget levels, setting ad time frames, promoting individual ads and any campaign optimization related to targeting and bidding in order to maximize performance of a campaign. In some cases, if you request assistance from LinkedIn and LinkedIn is able to provide such assistance, your customer success manager may help you in some areas of campaign management, such as strategies for setting target bids.

**2.3 Optional Features.** To the extent that you choose to utilize optional features made available in the LinkedIn Campaign Manager tool to help you optimize your LinkedIn ad campaigns, including conversion tracking, website demographics, retargeting, matched audiences, lead gen forms, and other features, you understand that additional requirements will apply for such optional features.

**2.4 Terms for Sponsorships**. If you agree to sponsor and/or market certain products and/or services on the LMS platform as outlined in an applicable IO (a “**Sponsorship**”), your Sponsorship will be governed by the terms located here: [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/sponsorship-program-terms](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/sponsorship-program-terms). You acknowledge and agree that 1, LinkedIn retains sole decision-making authority regarding the content, topics, guest speakers, and all aspects of the marketing, advertising, and promotion of the sponsorship, and 2, LinkedIn reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to decline or omit any ads, ad material, or content it reasonably believes may violate any law, regulation, or LinkedIn policy.

**3\. FEES, TAXES AND MEASUREMENTS**. You will pay LinkedIn the fees calculated by LinkedIn using LinkedIn's tracking mechanisms ("**Fees**"), and you agree to pay on the basis and at the rate shown when a campaign, order or other purchase was submitted through your account, e.g., price per impression, click, other conversion, lead or period, whether with a fixed or automatically optimized bid, whether with daily budget, lifetime pacing, or other budget options as further described [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/107019). LinkedIn’s measurements are the definitive measurements for calculating fees and other amounts owing as part of the Program. You will not, and will not authorize any third party to, generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions, inquiries, clicks or conversions. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges that LinkedIn must levy on the fees for advertising. Payments are non-refundable. 

LinkedIn has systems in place to attempt to detect and prevent certain forms of automated and fraudulent activity, but no such systems are perfect, and bot activity, click fraud, fraudulent leads, and other third-party invalid activity (collectively, “**Invalid Activity**”) may occur. You understand and agree that Invalid Activity may affect the Fees you are charged, and that LinkedIn is not liable for such Invalid Activity. LinkedIn may choose to notify you of Invalid Activity in its discretion, but it is not obligated to do so.

You further understand and agree that technological issues such as errors, defects, or software bugs (individually and collectively, "**Technological Issue(s)**”) may exist. LinkedIn will notify you if it determines that, during the time period within which 1, a Technological Issue(s) occurs and 2, LinkedIn is able to calculate its impact, a Technological Issue has increased your Fees for a specific ad type (as further described below) by (a), more than 5% of your spend against that ad type amount of the invoice, and also (b), by a total of more than USD $100.00.

Additionally, if you wish to dispute any Fees based on Invalid Activity or Technological Issues, your sole and exclusive remedy will be to make a claim for an Ad Services credit within 90 days of the date of that Invalid Activity or Technological Issue, and LinkedIn's exclusive liability is, in LinkedIn's sole discretion, to issue Ad Services credit. Any Ad Services credits that you may accrue are non-refundable and non-transferable, and must be used prior to termination of this Agreement or your ads account.

LinkedIn ad types include, but are not limited to, sponsored content, sponsored messaging, text, video, and dynamic ads, as described in this [Ads Guide](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/success/ads-guide).

**4\. NO GUARANTEES.** LINKEDIN MAKES NO GUARANTEES FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUCTION OR THE ADVERTISING PRODUCTS AND WILL USE ITS DISCRETION TO DETERMINE 1, WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL ADVERTISING PRODUCT IS PROMOTED AND 2, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ADVERTISING PRODUCTS THAT ARE PROMOTED. LINKEDIN DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE RESULTS OR DISTRIBUTION OF ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN ANY MANNER. LINKEDIN DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU ANY NUMBER OF SENDS, IMPRESSIONS, OPENS, VIEWS, CLICKS, OR ANY OTHER LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY ANY OF LINKEDIN’S ENGAGEMENT METRICS. LINKEDIN DOES NOT SCREEN OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION ON THE LINKEDIN.COM SITE OR IN THE MEMBER PROFILES, AND, AS SUCH, DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE IDENTITY OR PERSONAL INFORMATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL VIEW THE ADVERTISEMENT PRODUCTS YOU PURCHASE.

**5\. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LINKEDIN POLICIES.**

**5.1  Compliance with Laws and LinkedIn Data Processing Agreement**. You and LinkedIn agree that we will each comply with all applicable laws ("**Applicable Law(s)**"), rules and regulations in connection with our respective performances under these Terms, the Advertising Agreement, and the Program, including but not limited to, (a) corruption practice, bribery, and acts contrary to the public administration including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1, et seq.; (b) discrimination against employees or job applicants based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran status or disability; and (c) the import or export of the Services, including but not limited to trade laws such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and if either party processes Personal Data (as defined in Section 1 of the DPA) on behalf of the other pursuant to these Terms or the Program, they will each comply with the terms of the [LinkedIn Data Processing Agreement](https://legal.linkedin.com/dpa) (“**DPA**”). Additionally, and without limiting the prohibitions in the [Advertising Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy) or [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement), you will not, and you will not enable or authorize any third party to, (a) except with the explicit opt-in consent of the applicable individual, associate any data obtained in connection with the Program (“**Ad Program Data**”) with data that either directly identifies an individual or can be used to identify and individual and is subject to protection under Applicable Law ("**Personal Data**") or otherwise re-identify such data, or (b) target ads based on sensitive data (as addressed in our [Advertising Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy) or otherwise defined by Applicable Law) (“**Sensitive Data**”). You will also not transfer to LinkedIn any data that you know or reasonably should know was (1) collected from or about children under the age of 16, or (2) constitutes Sensitive Data. If and to the extent you do provide to LinkedIn any Personal Data in connection with these Terms or the Program, the sharing of which pursuant to the Agreement is regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation, you and LinkedIn will enter into and comply with the applicable [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://business.linkedin.com/c/15/10/eu-scc) (“**Standard Clauses**”), the terms of which are incorporated by reference into this Agreement and which supersede any existing Standard Clauses in place between you and LinkedIn. LinkedIn agrees that (i) the Standard Clauses will be updated if required under European law or regulations, and (ii) your affiliates may enter into Standard Clauses directly with LinkedIn.

**5.2   Compliance with LinkedIn Advertising Policies and Technical Specifications.** When you submit ad creatives to LinkedIn, you grant to LinkedIn the right to use, copy, and publish your ad creatives in connection with the performance under these Terms (including for review, delivery, testing, compliance, and promotional purposes). Your ad creatives must comply with LinkedIn’s advertising policies and technical specifications at all times, including the LinkedIn Advertising Policy located [here](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy). Additionally, in connection with our compliance and transparency efforts, we may preserve and display your Ads and information about them, including after the conclusion of your ad campaign or termination of this Agreement. This information may include, but is not limited to, estimated ad impressions, audience size, and targeting parameters 

**5.3 Third Party Analytics.** To the extent that you participate in data analysis, reporting, and attribution programs with authorized third parties, you grant LinkedIn the right to transfer your campaign and performance data to such third parties for the purposes of providing campaign analytics, reporting, and attribution services as well as for any other lawful purposes for which you have authorized such third parties to use such data, subject to these Terms. 

**6\. Languages**. If this Agreement is translated into a language other than English, the translation is for convenience only, and the English language version will govern.

**7. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver for U.S.-Based Customers** 

We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do and if you are a United States customer contracting with LinkedIn Corporation (as determined by our [Contracting Entity Terms](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flegal%2Fcontracting-entity-terms&data=02%7C01%7Crvolpineto%40linkedin.com%7Cfd020363a3da48a2455308d7f690fd09%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637248974895609773&sdata=oS%2B38oz5KnsRLYvzMD6i6iDjAmROwKXnJNwlbKu3kfo%3D&reserved=0)), you and LinkedIn agree to the following procedure to resolve disputes. Once a dispute arises, you and Linkedin agree to attempt to resolve it informally for at least 60 days following your or its sending the individualized Notice of Dispute described in Section 7.3, unless the claim qualifies for resolution by a small claims court pursuant to Section 7.4.  If we can’t, and if you don’t opt out of arbitration as described in section 7.8 below, then you and LinkedIn agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. In that event, a neutral arbitrator will decide the dispute and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review as provided under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. For the avoidance of doubt, if your Contracting Entity is anything other than LinkedIn Corporation, this Section 7 does not apply to you.

**7.1     Disputes covered — everything except IP and certain collection disputes.**

The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and LinkedIn or any LinkedIn affiliate concerning your advertising on the LinkedIn advertising platform, on any Properties, use of the LMS ad services, your advertising, its price, your purchase transaction, Technological Issues, Invalid Activity, billing, or these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver) under any legal theory including without limitation contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except (1) disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights, and (2) disputes where LinkedIn or its assignee is attempting to collect unpaid invoices, and the unpaid amount (excluding late fees and penalties) is less than ten thousand dollars.

**7.2  Prohibition of class actions and non-individualized relief.**

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LINKEDIN MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LINKEDIN BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim or any particular remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible.

**7.3     Provide an individualized Notice of Dispute first.**

If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send us an individualized Notice of Dispute by filling in this [form](https://www.linkedin-ei.com/help/lms/ask/nod). Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. We’ll send you an email with the same information if we have a dispute with you. Sixty days after you or we send an individualized Notice with the information listed above, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.

**7.4      Small claims court option.**

Instead of filling out this [form](https://www.linkedin-ei.com/help/lms/ask/nod) to submit an Individualized Notice of Dispute, you or LinkedIn may sue in small claims court if you or we meet the court’s requirements in the county of your principal place of business or Santa Clara County, California. If the small claims court does not fully resolve the dispute, then the dispute will be subject to arbitration as set forth in this Section 7.

**7.5     Arbitration procedure.**

The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 USD or less, whether or not you are an individual or how you use the LinkedIn Ad Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. Any arbitration will be initiated in and take place in the county of your principal place of business or Santa Clara County, California. You choose. In disputes involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including ruling on disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, or the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement.  But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity, and to enjoin any arbitration proceedings that don’t comply with these Terms.

**7.6     Arbitration fees and payments.**

**Disputes involving $75,000 USD or less.** Provided that you’ve sent us an individualized Notice of Dispute with the information listed in Section 7.3 above and tried to resolve the dispute informally for 60 days, we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. However, if the arbitrator finds that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), we will no longer pay your share of any fees or expenses, and the arbitrator may order you to reimburse us for any portion of your share of fees and expenses that we’ve already paid.

**Disputes involving more than $75,000 USD.** The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. But the arbitrator may order us to pay some or all of your share of AAA’s and the arbitrator’s fees and expenses if you can’t afford to pay them.

**7.7     Procedures for related cases.**

If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers or lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be considered “Related Cases.” Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 20 arbitrations at a time, and those arbitrations will be resolved in the manner described below. 

For the first batch, each side may select up to 10 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved individually in arbitrations as outlined in this Section 7. The batch consists of the Related Cases selected by each side. None of the other Related Cases may be filed in arbitration until the first batch of cases is resolved. If, after the first batch of cases is resolved, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 10 of the Related Cases to be resolved individually in arbitrations as outlined above in Section 7. This process of batched arbitrations will continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims either informally or through individual arbitrations. Statutes of limitations and other time-based defenses will be tolled following our receipt of your individualized Notice of Dispute with the information listed in Section 7.3 above as long as a Related Case to your individualized Notice of Dispute is pending.

The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different claimants.

The procedures above supersede and replace the AAA’s Supplemental Rules for Multiple Case Filings (and any similar rules the AAA may adopt), which will not apply to arbitrations filed under these Terms. A court will have the exclusive authority to enforce Section 7.7, including the question whether Section 7.7 applies to a given set of cases and the ability to prevent the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with the process outlined in Section 7.7.

**7.8     The applicability of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, and your option to opt out of it.**

These Terms go into effect between you and LinkedIn as soon as you launch a campaign, run an ad on the LinkedIn advertising platform, access our Campaign Manager tool, or otherwise register for, access, or use our ad services on any of our Properties. It governs all disputes described in Section 7.1 above, except that it doesn’t require you to arbitrate cases that are already pending in court when these Terms go into effect. If a class action is already pending in court when these Terms go into effect and the court in that proceeding certifies a class that includes you, you may participate in the class if you wish to. But unless you opt out of this Section 7 as provided below, you may not bring or participate in any other class action against us.

You may opt out of this Section 7 by sending us a notice by email to ArbitrationOptOut@linkedin.com within 30 days after these Terms goes into effect. The notice must contain your name, your address (or other information that we can use to contact you), a statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, and the account numbers that you’ve used on our online advertising platform or for our ad services for which you’re opting out.  If we make material changes to this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, you may opt out of those changes (but not the entire Arbitration Agreement and Class Waiver) by sending us notice within 30 days after the changes go into effect. If you do, the most recent version of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver before the change you rejected will apply.

**7.9     Severability.**

If any part of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this Section 7 will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow a class-wide arbitration, a representative arbitration, an arbitration seeking a public injunction, or arbitrations of more than 20 Related Cases at a time, then this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver will be unenforceable in its entirety with respect to each such proceeding that would otherwise be arbitrated, and those proceedings will occur exclusively in court, not in arbitration.

**7.10  Conflict with AAA rules.**

If these Terms conflict with the AAA’s rules, these Terms govern.

**7.11  LinkedIn affiliates are third-party beneficiaries.**

Affiliates of LinkedIn who are not parties to this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver are third-party beneficiaries of your agreement with us to resolve disputes through informal negotiation and arbitration and the other provisions of this Section 7.

LinkedIn will not substantively respond to any such request without Customer’s prior written authorization.

**5.3 Assistance to Customer.** LinkedIn will provide reasonable assistance to Customer regarding:

a. Any requests from Customer data subjects in respect of access to or the rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, blocking or deletion of Customer Personal Data that LinkedIn Processes for Customer. In the event that a data subject sends such a request directly to LinkedIn, LinkedIn will promptly send such request to Customer;

b. The investigation of Personal Data Breaches and the notification to the Supervisory Authority and Customer's data subjects regarding such Personal Data Breaches; and

c. Where appropriate, the preparation of data protection impact assessments and, where necessary, carrying out consultations with any Supervisory Authority.

**5.4 Required Processing.** If LinkedIn is required by Data Protection Requirements to Process any Customer Personal Data for a reason other than providing the services described in the Agreement, LinkedIn will inform Customer of this requirement in advance of any Processing, unless LinkedIn is legally prohibited from informing Customer of such Processing (e.g., as a result of secrecy requirements that may exist under applicable EU member state laws).

**5.5 Security.** LinkedIn will:

a. Maintain appropriate organizational and technical security measures (which may include, with respect to personnel, facilities, hardware and software, storage and networks, access controls, monitoring and logging, vulnerability and breach detection, incident response, encryption of Customer Personal Data while in transit and at rest) designed to protect against unauthorized or accidental access, loss, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Customer Personal Data, including the security measures set forth in Schedule D to this DPA, which shall apply as Annex II of the SCCs;

b. Be responsible for the sufficiency of the security, privacy, and confidentiality safeguards of all LinkedIn personnel with respect to Customer Personal Data and liable for any failure by such LinkedIn personnel to meet the terms of this DPA;

c. Take reasonable steps to confirm that all LinkedIn personnel are protecting the security, privacy and confidentiality of Customer Personal Data consistent with the requirements of this DPA, which shall apply as Annex II of the SCCs; and

d. Notify Customer of any Personal Data Breach by LinkedIn, its Subprocessors, or any other third parties acting on LinkedIn’s behalf without undue delay and in any event within 48 hours of becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach.

e. If a Personal Data Breach results from either (i) the negligence or intentional misconduct of LinkedIn (or any LinkedIn Subprocessor consistent with Section 5.1(f)) or (ii) a material failure of LinkedIn to comply with the terms of this DPA, LinkedIn shall bear all costs associated with investigating and remediating the Personal Data Breach. LinkedIn shall provide reasonable reimbursement to Customer for any costs associated with notifying affected individuals as required by law or providing individuals with credit monitoring or other appropriate remediation services, provided that LinkedIn, as a processor, will adhere to its commitments under 5.3(b) of this DPA.

#### **6\. AUDIT, CERTIFICATION**

**6.1 Supervisory Authority Audit of Customer.** If a Supervisory Authority requires an audit of the data processing facilities from which LinkedIn Processes Customer Personal Data in order to ascertain or monitor Customer's compliance with Data Protection Requirements, LinkedIn will cooperate with such audit. Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to such audit, including all reasonable costs and fees for any and all time LinkedIn expends for any such audit, in addition to the rates for services performed by LinkedIn.

**6.2 Audits.** Upon request, LinkedIn will provide to Customer each year an opinion or Service Organization Control report provided by an accredited, third-party audit firm under the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 (“**SSAE 18**”) (Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization) or the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402 (“**ISAE 3402**”) (Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization) standards applicable to the services under the Agreement (each such report, a “**Report**”). If a Report does not provide, in Customer’s reasonable judgment, sufficient information to confirm LinkedIn’s compliance with the terms of this DPA, then Customer or an accredited third-party audit firm agreed to by both Customer and LinkedIn may audit LinkedIn’s compliance with the terms of this DPA during regular business hours, with reasonable advance notice to LinkedIn and subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures. Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to such audit, including all reasonable costs and fees for any and all time LinkedIn expends for any such audit, in addition to the rates for services performed by LinkedIn. Before the commencement of any such audit, Customer and LinkedIn shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit. Customer shall promptly notify LinkedIn with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit. Customer may not audit LinkedIn more than once annually.

#### **7\. DATA TRANSFERS**

**7.1** For transfers of EU Personal Data to LinkedIn for processing by LinkedIn in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 2 of the SCCs for Controller to Processor transfers, which are incorporated herein by reference. The parties agree that the following terms apply: (i) the Data Protection Commission of Ireland shall be the competent Supervisory Authority pursuant to Clause 13 of the SCCs; (ii) data subjects for whom a LinkedIn entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the applicable SCCs; (iii) the SCCs shall be governed by the law of Ireland, which allows for third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to Clause 17 of the SCCs; and (iv) any dispute arising from the SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland pursuant to Clause 18 of the SCCs. Schedule A to this DPA shall apply as Annex I of SCCs and Schedule D shall apply at Annex II of the SCCs.

**7.2** If LinkedIn is unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then EU Personal Data will be processed and used exclusively within the territory of a member state of the European Union and any movement of EU Personal Data to a non-EU country requires the prior written consent of Customer. LinkedIn shall promptly notify Customer of any inability by LinkedIn to comply with the provisions of this Section 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the transfers contemplated under this Section 7 result in transfers of UK Personal Data to LinkedIn for processing by LinkedIn in a jurisdiction other than in the UK or UK Information Commissioner’s Office-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, (1) each party agrees it will use the 2010 Controller-to-Processor SCCs for so long as such SCCs are lawfully permitted for such transfers of UK Personal Data, and (2) Schedules A and D shall apply as Annex I and Annex II, respectively. In the event that the UK Information Commissioner’s Office confirms that a “UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses” (“**UK Addendum**”) is required to rely lawfully on the SCCs for transfers of UK Personal Data, then (a) the SCCs used for EU Personal Data shall also apply to transfers of UK Personal Data; (b) the UK Addendum shall be deemed executed between Customer and LinkedIn; and (c) the SCCs between the parties shall be deemed amended as specified in the UK Addendum in respect of the transfer of such UK Personal Data. The UK Information Commissioner is the exclusive Supervisory Authority for the transfers of UK Personal Data under this Agreement.

#### **8\. DATA RETURN AND DELETION**

The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services or upon Customer’s reasonable request, LinkedIn shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, return all the Customer Personal Data and copies of such data to Customer or securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent LinkedIn from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed. In such case, LinkedIn agrees to preserve the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data retained by it and that it will only actively Process such Customer Personal Data after such date in order to comply with applicable laws. For clarity, LinkedIn may continue to Process Customer Personal Data that has been aggregated in a manner that does not identify individuals or customers to improve LinkedIn’s systems and services.  

#### **9\. CONTROLLER-TO-CONTROLLER SCENARIOS**

Certain Services may offer integrated viewing and export of Personal Data of LinkedIn members that Customer already may access on LinkedIn’s website, LinkedIn.com, consistent with member privacy settings. For purposes of GDPR, where there is a member-directed export of Personal Data or where Customer already may access such Personal Data, both Customer and LinkedIn will be independent controllers of Personal Data originally derived on the LinkedIn Services. The parties agree that, for such cases, LinkedIn and Customer would each act as a data controller with respect to their particular copy of the Personal Data. Each party will, to the extent that it, along with the other party, acts as data controller, as the term is defined in applicable Data Protection Requirements, with respect to Personal Data, reasonably cooperate with the other party to enable the exercise of data protection rights as set forth in the Data Protection Requirements. Where both parties each act as data controller with respect to Personal Data, and the transfer of data between the parties results in a transfer of EU Personal Data to a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 1 of the SCCs, which are incorporated herein by reference. The parties agree that the following terms apply: (i) the Data Protection Commission of Ireland shall be the competent Supervisory Authority pursuant to Clause 13 of the SCCs; (ii) data subjects for whom a LinkedIn entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the applicable SCCs; (iii) the SCCs shall be governed by the law of Ireland, which allows for third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to Clause 17 of the SCCs; and (iv) any dispute arising from the SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland pursuant to Clause 18 of the SCCs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the transfers contemplated under this Section 9 results in a transfer of UK Personal Data to a jurisdiction other than in the UK or UK Information Commissioner’s Office-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, (1) the 2004 Controller-to-Controller SCCs, which are incorporated herein by reference, will apply for so long as such SCCs are lawfully permitted for such transfers of UK Personal Data, (2) Schedule A and Schedule D shall apply as Annex B and Annex II, respectively, and (3) for purpose of Section II(h), the data importer will process the UK Personal Data, at its option, in accordance with the data processing principles set out in Annex A of the Controller-to-Controller SCCs. In the event that the UK Information Commissioner’s Office confirms that a UK Addendum is required to rely lawfully on the SCCs contemplated under this Section 9 for transfers of UK Personal Data, then (a) SCCs used for EU Personal Data under this Section 9 shall also apply to transfers of UK Personal Data; (b) the UK Addendum shall be deemed executed between Customer and LinkedIn; and (c) the SCCs between the parties shall be deemed amended as specified in the UK Addendum in respect of the transfer of such UK Personal Data..

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the parties acknowledge and agree that each is acting independently as Data Controller with respect of Personal Data and the parties are not joint controllers as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation and UK GDPR.

#### **10\. THIRD PARTY DATA PROCESSORS**

Customer acknowledges that in the provision of some services (such as Applicant Tracking Systems, Learning Management Systems, and Customer Management Systems), LinkedIn, on receipt of instructions from Customer, may transfer Customer Personal Data to and otherwise interact with third party data processors. Customer agrees that if and to the extent such transfers occur, Customer is responsible for entering into separate contractual arrangements with such third-party data processors binding them to comply with obligations in accordance with Data Protection Requirements. For avoidance of doubt, such third-party data processors are not Subprocessors.

#### **11\. TERM**

This DPA shall remain in effect as long as LinkedIn carries out Personal Data processing operations on behalf of Customer or until the termination of the LinkedIn Contract (and all Personal Data has been returned or deleted in accordance with Section 8 above).

#### **12\. GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE**

Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of Ireland, and any action or proceeding related to this DPA (including those arising from non-contractual disputes or claims) will be brought in Dublin, Ireland. However, where a dispute arises regarding the processing of UK Personal Data under this DPA, such dispute shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Addendum will have the meanings given to them in the DPA. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the DPA, will have the meanings given to them under the CCPA.

No CCPA Sale. The parties agree that for the purposes of the CCPA, LinkedIn acts as a CCPA Service Provider for Customer Personal Data. By executing the ordering document,

> SCHEDULE C

> GLINT-SPECIFIC TERMS AND AMENDMENTS

The following terms and conditions amend the DPA with respect to only those LinkedIn products and services offered under the Glint brand (including Glint Engage and Glint Perform). For avoidance of doubt, if Customer purchases Glint services as provided under the Agreement (“Glint Services”) in addition to LinkedIn-branded services, the following amendments apply only with respect to those Glint products or services and the DPA will apply unamended with respect to the LinkedIn-branded services.

**_The following clauses are added to the DPA as a new Section 4.3:_**

   _4.3 Notice and Choice._ 

   _a. Customer agrees to provide appropriate notices to its Customer Users of the Glint Services about and, if required by Data Protection Requirements, obtain appropriate consent or other appropriate legal basis from such Customer Users for: (i) the collection, transfer and processing of Customer Personal Data through LinkedIn’s services and (ii) Customer’s use of any service providers or other third-parties that Customer instructs LinkedIn to send Customer Personal Data to or provide Customer Personal Data to LinkedIn. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer may provide LinkedIn with Personal Data for the purpose of enabling LinkedIn to provide the LinkedIn services. Customer represents and warrants that it has the necessary right and full power and authority to provide the Personal Data to LinkedIn._ 

   _b. Customer will decide the content of “User Confidentiality Notices” that will be provided to Customer Users (e.g., for Glint Engage, a survey Confidentiality Notice) relating to the degree of confidentiality and aggregation threshold that a Customer User will have and, if applicable, any required disclosures under any Data Protection Requirement (e.g., Art. 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation). At Customer’s option, Customer may use a default LinkedIn User Confidentiality Notice. Customer’s Master Admin will provide LinkedIn with the User Confidentiality Notice at least three (3) business days prior to use. Customer agrees that it will not modify or delete any portion of the User Confidentiality Notice or include any statements in any communication with a Customer User that imposes any obligation on LinkedIn or in any way modifies, contradicts, or supplements User Confidentiality Notice provided to LinkedIn. Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring that its use of Customer Personal Data and the User Confidentiality Notice complies with all applicable Data Protection Requirements._ 

**_The following clauses are added to the DPA as a new Section 4.4:_**

   _4.4 Aggregation and Non-Identification. To the extent a User Confidentiality Notice informs Customer Users that the Customer will only receive data from LinkedIn in an aggregated form, Customer agrees it will not receive, nor attempt to discern, any such Customer Personal Data in a form that identifies individual Customer Users with Customer Personal Data._

**_The first sentence of Section 5.1.a of the DPA is replaced with the following sentence:_**

   _Process Customer Personal Data (i) only for the purpose of providing, supporting and improving the Glint Services (including by providing aggregated, non-identifiable insights to improve the Glint Services and LinkedIn services, and providing survey benchmarking data to LinkedIn customers, where both the data subject and Customer have been de-identified), using appropriate technical and organizational security measures; and (ii) in compliance with the instructions received from Customer._ 

**_Section 5.1.g of the DPA is replaced in its entirety with the following clause:_**

   _Upon request, provide Customer with a summary of LinkedIn's security policies applicable to the Glint-branded services._

**_Section 8 of the DPA is replaced in its entirety with the following clauses:_**

   _The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services, LinkedIn shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent LinkedIn from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed: (i) return to Customer all the Customer Personal Data, including survey responses if the Customer User Confidentiality Notice disclosed Customer would receive responses identified to individuals, or (ii) securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures or (iii) export Customer Personal Data in a non-aggregated form to Customer’s new service provider under a separate written agreement reasonably satisfactory to LinkedIn under which Customer and the recipient of the data accept responsibility and liability for the Customer Personal Data subsequent to transfer or export. LinkedIn agrees to preserve the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data retained by it and that it will only actively process such Customer Personal Data after such date in order to comply with applicable Data Protection Requirements. For clarity, after termination of the LinkedIn Contract, LinkedIn may continue to process Customer Personal Data that has been aggregated in a manner that does not identify individuals or customers to improve LinkedIn’s systems and services._

**_Sections 9 and 10 of the DPA will not apply in the context of Glint products or services._**

LinkedIn shall provide reasonable reimbursement to Customer for any costs associated with notifying affected individuals as required by law or providing individuals with credit monitoring or other appropriate remediation services, provided that LinkedIn, as a processor, will adhere to its commitments under 5.3(b) of this DPA.

#### **6\. AUDIT, CERTIFICATION**

**6.1 Supervisory Authority Audit of Customer.** If a Supervisory Authority requires an audit of the data processing facilities from which LinkedIn Processes Customer Personal Data in order to ascertain or monitor Customer's compliance with Data Protection Requirements, LinkedIn will cooperate with such audit.

Customer shall promptly notify LinkedIn with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit. Customer may not audit LinkedIn more than once annually.

#### **7\. DATA TRANSFERS**

**7.1** For transfers of EU Personal Data to LinkedIn for processing by LinkedIn in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 2 of the SCCs for Controller to Processor transfers, which are incorporated herein by reference. The parties agree that the following terms apply: (i) the Data Protection Commission of Ireland shall be the competent Supervisory Authority pursuant to Clause 13 of the SCCs; (ii) data subjects for whom a LinkedIn entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the applicable SCCs; (iii) the SCCs shall be governed by the law of Ireland, which allows for third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to Clause 17 of the SCCs; and (iv) any dispute arising from the SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland pursuant to Clause 18 of the SCCs. Schedule A to this DPA shall apply as Annex I of SCCs and Schedule D shall apply at Annex II of the SCCs.

**7.2** If LinkedIn is unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then EU Personal Data will be processed and used exclusively within the territory of a member state of the European Union and any movement of EU Personal Data to a non-EU country requires the prior written consent of Customer. LinkedIn shall promptly notify Customer of any inability by LinkedIn to comply with the provisions of this Section 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the transfers contemplated under this Section 7 result in transfers of UK Personal Data to LinkedIn for processing by LinkedIn in a jurisdiction other than in the UK or UK Information Commissioner’s Office-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, (1) each party agrees it will use the 2010 Controller-to-Processor SCCs for so long as such SCCs are lawfully permitted for such transfers of UK Personal Data, and (2) Schedules A and D shall apply as Annex I and Annex II, respectively. In the event that the UK Information Commissioner’s Office confirms that a “UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses” (“**UK Addendum**”) is required to rely lawfully on the SCCs for transfers of UK Personal Data, then (a) the SCCs used for EU Personal Data shall also apply to transfers of UK Personal Data; (b) the UK Addendum shall be deemed executed between Customer and LinkedIn; and (c) the SCCs between the parties shall be deemed amended as specified in the UK Addendum in respect of the transfer of such UK Personal Data. The UK Information Commissioner is the exclusive Supervisory Authority for the transfers of UK Personal Data under this Agreement.

#### **8\. DATA RETURN AND DELETION**

The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services or upon Customer’s reasonable request, LinkedIn shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, return all the Customer Personal Data and copies of such data to Customer or securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent LinkedIn from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed. In such case, LinkedIn agrees to preserve the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data retained by it and that it will only actively Process such Customer Personal Data after such date in order to comply with applicable laws. For clarity, LinkedIn may continue to Process Customer Personal Data that has been aggregated in a manner that does not identify individuals or customers to improve LinkedIn’s systems and services.  

#### **9\. CONTROLLER-TO-CONTROLLER SCENARIOS**

Certain Services may offer integrated viewing and export of Personal Data of LinkedIn members that Customer already may access on LinkedIn’s website, LinkedIn.com, consistent with member privacy settings. For purposes of GDPR, where there is a member-directed export of Personal Data or where Customer already may access such Personal Data, both Customer and LinkedIn will be independent controllers of Personal Data originally derived on the LinkedIn Services. The parties agree that, for such cases, LinkedIn and Customer would each act as a data controller with respect to their particular copy of the Personal Data. Each party will, to the extent that it, along with the other party, acts as data controller, as the term is defined in applicable Data Protection Requirements, with respect to Personal Data, reasonably cooperate with the other party to enable the exercise of data protection rights as set forth in the Data Protection Requirements. Where both parties each act as data controller with respect to Personal Data, and the transfer of data between the parties results in a transfer of EU Personal Data to a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 1 of the SCCs, which are incorporated herein by reference. The parties agree that the following terms apply: (i) the Data Protection Commission of Ireland shall be the competent Supervisory Authority pursuant to Clause 13 of the SCCs; (ii) data subjects for whom a LinkedIn entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the applicable SCCs; (iii) the SCCs shall be governed by the law of Ireland, which allows for third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to Clause 17 of the SCCs; and (iv) any dispute arising from the SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland pursuant to Clause 18 of the SCCs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the transfers contemplated under this Section 9 results in a transfer of UK Personal Data to a jurisdiction other than in the UK or UK Information Commissioner’s Office-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, (1) the 2004 Controller-to-Controller SCCs, which are incorporated herein by reference, will apply for so long as such SCCs are lawfully permitted for such transfers of UK Personal Data, (2) Schedule A and Schedule D shall apply as Annex B and Annex II, respectively, and (3) for purpose of Section II(h), the data importer will process the UK Personal Data, at its option, in accordance with the data processing principles set out in Annex A of the Controller-to-Controller SCCs. In the event that the UK Information Commissioner’s Office confirms that a UK Addendum is required to rely lawfully on the SCCs contemplated under this Section 9 for transfers of UK Personal Data, then (a) SCCs used for EU Personal Data under this Section 9 shall also apply to transfers of UK Personal Data; (b) the UK Addendum shall be deemed executed between Customer and LinkedIn; and (c) the SCCs between the parties shall be deemed amended as specified in the UK Addendum in respect of the transfer of such UK Personal Data..

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the parties acknowledge and agree that each is acting independently as Data Controller with respect of Personal Data and the parties are not joint controllers as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation and UK GDPR.

#### **10\. THIRD PARTY DATA PROCESSORS**

Customer acknowledges that in the provision of some services (such as Applicant Tracking Systems, Learning Management Systems, and Customer Management Systems), LinkedIn, on receipt of instructions from Customer, may transfer Customer Personal Data to and otherwise interact with third party data processors. Customer agrees that if and to the extent such transfers occur, Customer is responsible for entering into separate contractual arrangements with such third-party data processors binding them to comply with obligations in accordance with Data Protection Requirements. For avoidance of doubt, such third-party data processors are not Subprocessors.

#### **11\. TERM**

This DPA shall remain in effect as long as LinkedIn carries out Personal Data processing operations on behalf of Customer or until the termination of the LinkedIn Contract (and all Personal Data has been returned or deleted in accordance with Section 8 above).

#### **12\. GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE**

Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of Ireland, and any action or proceeding related to this DPA (including those arising from non-contractual disputes or claims) will be brought in Dublin, Ireland. However, where a dispute arises regarding the processing of UK Personal Data under this DPA, such dispute shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

> SCHEDULE C

The following terms and conditions amend the DPA with respect to only those LinkedIn products and services offered under the Glint brand (including Glint Engage and Glint Perform). For avoidance of doubt, if Customer purchases Glint services as provided under the Agreement (“Glint Services”) in addition to LinkedIn-branded services, the following amendments apply only with respect to those Glint products or services and the DPA will apply unamended with respect to the LinkedIn-branded services.

**_The following clauses are added to the DPA as a new Section 4.3:_**

   _4.3 Notice and Choice._ 

   _a. Customer agrees to provide appropriate notices to its Customer Users of the Glint Services about and, if required by Data Protection Requirements, obtain appropriate consent or other appropriate legal basis from such Customer Users for: (i) the collection, transfer and processing of Customer Personal Data through LinkedIn’s services and (ii) Customer’s use of any service providers or other third-parties that Customer instructs LinkedIn to send Customer Personal Data to or provide Customer Personal Data to LinkedIn. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer may provide LinkedIn with Personal Data for the purpose of enabling LinkedIn to provide the LinkedIn services. Customer represents and warrants that it has the necessary right and full power and authority to provide the Personal Data to LinkedIn._ 

   _b. Customer will decide the content of “User Confidentiality Notices” that will be provided to Customer Users (e.g., for Glint Engage, a survey Confidentiality Notice) relating to the degree of confidentiality and aggregation threshold that a Customer User will have and, if applicable, any required disclosures under any Data Protection Requirement (e.g., Art. 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation). At Customer’s option, Customer may use a default LinkedIn User Confidentiality Notice. Customer’s Master Admin will provide LinkedIn with the User Confidentiality Notice at least three (3) business days prior to use. Customer agrees that it will not modify or delete any portion of the User Confidentiality Notice or include any statements in any communication with a Customer User that imposes any obligation on LinkedIn or in any way modifies, contradicts, or supplements User Confidentiality Notice provided to LinkedIn. Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring that its use of Customer Personal Data and the User Confidentiality Notice complies with all applicable Data Protection Requirements._ 

**_The following clauses are added to the DPA as a new Section 4.4:_**

   _4.4 Aggregation and Non-Identification. To the extent a User Confidentiality Notice informs Customer Users that the Customer will only receive data from LinkedIn in an aggregated form, Customer agrees it will not receive, nor attempt to discern, any such Customer Personal Data in a form that identifies individual Customer Users with Customer Personal Data._

**_The first sentence of Section 5.1.a of the DPA is replaced with the following sentence:_**

   _Process Customer Personal Data (i) only for the purpose of providing, supporting and improving the Glint Services (including by providing aggregated, non-identifiable insights to improve the Glint Services and LinkedIn services, and providing survey benchmarking data to LinkedIn customers, where both the data subject and Customer have been de-identified), using appropriate technical and organizational security measures; and (ii) in compliance with the instructions received from Customer._ 

**_Section 5.1.g of the DPA is replaced in its entirety with the following clause:_**

   _Upon request, provide Customer with a summary of LinkedIn's security policies applicable to the Glint-branded services._

**_Section 8 of the DPA is replaced in its entirety with the following clauses:_**

   _The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services, LinkedIn shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent LinkedIn from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed: (i) return to Customer all the Customer Personal Data, including survey responses if the Customer User Confidentiality Notice disclosed Customer would receive responses identified to individuals, or (ii) securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures or (iii) export Customer Personal Data in a non-aggregated form to Customer’s new service provider under a separate written agreement reasonably satisfactory to LinkedIn under which Customer and the recipient of the data accept responsibility and liability for the Customer Personal Data subsequent to transfer or export. LinkedIn agrees to preserve the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data retained by it and that it will only actively process such Customer Personal Data after such date in order to comply with applicable Data Protection Requirements. For clarity, after termination of the LinkedIn Contract, LinkedIn may continue to process Customer Personal Data that has been aggregated in a manner that does not identify individuals or customers to improve LinkedIn’s systems and services._
