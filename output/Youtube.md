We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/youtube/#topic=7505892). Among other things, you can find out about [YouTube Kids](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/#topic=6130504), the [YouTube Partner Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9223152) and [YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9223117) (where available).You can also read all about enjoying content on [other devices](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9257096?ref_topic=9257500) [like your television, your games console, or](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9257096?ref_topic=9257500) [Google Home](https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7029380).  

**Your Service Provider**

The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “**YouTube**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).

**Applicable Terms  
**Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) and the [Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies](https://www.youtube.com/t/policies) which may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the [Advertising on YouTube Policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/30084?ref_topic=2972865) if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the Agreement.

Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.

You can follow these instructions to [create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).

To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on third-party applications. Learn more about [keeping your Google account secure](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/46526), including what to do if you learn of any unauthorised use of your password or Google account.

**Your Information  
**Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service. The [YouTube Kids Privacy Notice](https://kids.youtube.com/t/privacynotice) provides additional information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids.

We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the [YouTube Data Processing Terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms_dataprocessing), except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities. [Learn More](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=data_applicability).

**Permissions and Restrictions  
**You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and applicable law. You may view or listen to Content for your personal, non-commercial use. You may also show YouTube videos through the embeddable YouTube player.

The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to:

1.  access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders;

**Reservation**

Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.

**Develop, Improve and Update** **the Service**

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user.  When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) subject to applicable law and policies.  

**Your Content and Conduct**
----------------------------

**Uploading Content**

If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines)) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.

**Rights you Grant**

You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.

**License to YouTube**

By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates’) business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.

**License to Other Users**

You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.

**Duration of License**

The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.

**Right to Monetize**

You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.

**Removing Your Content**

You may [remove your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770) from the Service at any time. You also have the option to [make a copy of your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100) before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.

**Removal of Content By YouTube**

If we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the [Troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024) page of our Help Center.

**Community Guidelines Strikes**
--------------------------------

YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.  A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the [Community Guidelines Strikes Basics](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032) page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may [appeal here](https://studio.youtube.com/).

If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service.

**Copyright Protection**

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center). If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please [send us a notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center), where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.

**Account Suspension & Termination**
------------------------------------

**Terminations by You  
**You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these [instructions](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account) to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.

**Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube**

YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.  

**Notice for Termination or Suspension**

We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.

**Effect of Account Suspension or Termination**

If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your that the termination or suspension has been made in error, you can [appeal using this form](https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube).

**About Software in the Service**
---------------------------------

**Downloadable Software  
**When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.

**Open Source  
**Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.  

**Other Legal Terms**
---------------------

**Warranty Disclaimer**  
OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND YOUTUBE DOES NOT MAKE ANY SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT: (A) THE CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE; (B) THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE SERVICE, OR ITS ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT YOU SUBMIT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE ON THE SERVICE.

**Limitation of Liability**

THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO ANY CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM ASSERTED IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUTUBE AND ITS AFFILIATES’ TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT YOUTUBE HAS PAID TO YOU FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE DATE OF YOUR NOTICE, IN WRITING TO YOUTUBE, OF THE CLAIM AND (B) USD $500.

**Indemnity**

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your unlawful use of and access to the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party, in each case except to the extent caused by Google’s negligence, willful misconduct or breach. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the Service.

**Third-Party Links  
**The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services. Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each third-party website and online service that you visit.

**About this Agreement**
------------------------

**Changing** **this Agreement**We may change this Agreement, for example (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business - for example, when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change this Agreement, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new product or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove any Content you uploaded and stop using the Service.

If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.

**No Waiver  
**If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).

**Interpretation**

In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes.

**All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service will be governed by California law, except California’s conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. You and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.  To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

Welcome to YouTube Paid Services!

**1.        Our Service**
-------------------------

Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform. YouTube enables access to certain premium features or content in exchange for one-time or recurring fees (each a "**Paid Service**"). The Paid Services include YouTube rentals and purchases, channel memberships, paid subscriptions, and other YouTube services which may be offered by Google.

### **1.1         Your Service Provider**

The entity providing the Paid Services is Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

We may use other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group, now or in the future (these companies are referred to as our “**Affiliates**”) to manage Paid Services.

Any payments you make for the Paid Services will be taken by Google Digital Inc., located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Together, Google LLC and Google Digital Inc., are "**Google, "we**", "**us**", or "**our**".

### **1.2         Applicable Terms**

Your transactions and any use of the Paid Services are subject to: these Paid Service Terms of Service; the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms); the [Paid Service Usage Rules](https://www.youtube.com/t/usage_paycontent); and the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). We’ll refer to these documents together as the “**Terms**”.

Please read the Terms carefully and make sure you understand them. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you may not use the Paid Services. Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order a subscription or an item of content), you will enter into a separate contract with us for that particular Paid Service and will be asked to accept the Paid Service Terms again.

**2.        Accessing Paid Services**
-------------------------------------

### **2.1         Age Requirements**

The age requirements in the YouTube Terms of Service also apply to your use of the Paid Services. You must also comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Paid Services (for example an age restriction on a movie).  Family managers and family members must meet these additional requirements as well.

### **2.2        Device Requirements and Usage Limits**

Certain Paid Services may require you to use a device that meets the system and compatibility requirements for that Paid Service, which may change from time to time. For further information on supported devices and technical requirements, visit our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_topic). There may also be limits on how you can access or use the different types of Paid Services on YouTube (e.g., applicable viewing periods and device limitations). Please see the [YouTube Paid Service Usage Rules](https://www.youtube.com/t/usage_paycontent) for more information.

### **2.3        Geographic Restrictions**

The Paid Services, and certain content available within the Paid Services, may only be available in certain countries. You agree that you will not present any false, inaccurate or misleading information in an effort to misrepresent your country of residence, and you will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Paid Services or content available within the Paid Services.

### **2.4        Other Google Paid Services**

In some cases, you may be able to access a Paid Service through other Google products (e.g., you may be able to watch a movie on Google Play that you purchased on YouTube).  Additionally, you may be able to access content via YouTube that you have purchased, or subscribed to, through other Google products (e.g. you may be able to watch a movie on YouTube that you purchased on Google Play).  Your use of any Paid Service is governed only by the Terms, and not the terms of any other Google product, including any other Google product through which you receive access to a Paid Service.

### **2.5         Your Information**

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Paid Services.  Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.

**3.        Payment and Free Trials**
-------------------------------------

### **3.1        Payment**

Google accepts payment via the payment method indicated prior to your purchase. You must have a valid, accepted payment method on file in order to purchase Paid Services, or to participate in no-cost trial offers or other no-cost offers related to the Paid Services. You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order. Google will charge your payment method for the price listed for the relevant Paid Service along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations. If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Service subscription, you agree that Google will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other reason, and Google is unable to charge you on the next billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Service until you update your payment method. Where possible, we will provide you with notice when this happens. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time following that notice, Google may cancel your subscription. In some cases, you may transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Service (e.g., if you subscribe to YouTube Premium using another platform like Apple or Google Play).  In these cases, such platform will charge your payment method and be responsible for managing any issues with your payment, including refunds.

### **3.2        Free Trials**

Google may offer free trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time. If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that includes a trial, you will receive access to that Paid Service for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period.

### **3.3        Discounts**

Google may, from time to time, offer discounts on purchases or subscriptions (such as a YouTube family plan or student plan). Additional terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, may apply to such plans and any such additional terms will be made available to you prior to purchase.  

### **3.4         Pre-Orders**

Google may offer the ability to pre-order certain items of content that are available within the Paid Services. When you place a pre-order, unless otherwise noted at the time, your payment method will not be charged until the date when the relevant item of content is made available to you. You can cancel a pre-order at any time up to the point at which the relevant item of content is made available. In some cases, Google may need to cancel a pre-order you have placed, in which case we will notify you.

### **3.5        Taxes**

If Google is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.

**4.        Cancellations and Refunds**
---------------------------------------

### **4.1        Cancellation of Subscriptions**

If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period. The cancellation will take effect at the end of that billing period. You will retain access to the Paid Service from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period and, unless otherwise indicated in the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy), you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.

### **4.2        Cancellation of Purchases or Rentals**

You can cancel your purchase and receive a refund as long as you have not commenced using the relevant Paid Service ordered and you make your request no later than 7 working days after your order is completed.  We reserve the right to approve or deny refund requests after 7 working days at our sole discretion, except where the Paid Service is defective, in which case the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy#zippy=%2cyoutube-premium-youtube-music-premium-memberships%2cmovie-show-purchases-or-rentals%2cticketed-live-events%2csuper-chat%2csuper-stickers%2csuper-thanks%2cdonations%2cchannel-memberships%2crefund-timelines) will apply. If you receive a refund for any reason, Google reserves the right to terminate your access to the relevant Paid Service purchased.

### **4.3        Refunds**

Google offers additional rights of refund for several types of Paid Services, including digital content, as set out in the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy).  

**5.        License**
---------------------

After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for a Paid Service, you may access and use that Paid Service, for your personal, non-commercial use only, and as long as you comply with the Terms and the law. Your license to the Paid Services (including any content offered through the Paid Services) is non-exclusive and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Google and its licensors. You agree not to use any Paid Service, in whole or in part, in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged (except where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement).

**6\.         Restrictions**
----------------------------

When you use the Paid Services, you may not (or attempt to):

*   use the Paid Services in an illegal manner, or for an illegal purpose;
*   share your Google account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid Service they did not order;
*   copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the Paid Services to any third party;
*   circumvent, reverse engineer, modify, disable, or otherwise tamper with any security technology that Google uses to protect the Paid Services or encourage or help anyone else to do so;
*   access the Paid Services other than by means authorized by Google; or
*   remove any proprietary notices or labels on Paid Services (for example watermarks).

**7.        Changes**
---------------------

### **7.1        Changes to the Paid Services**

We’re constantly developing new features and ways to improve our services and we may modify the Service (including the Paid Services) as set out in the YouTube Terms of Service. Changes to a Paid Service will not affect your ability to request a refund as described above.

### **7.2        Removal or Unavailability of Content**

The availability of content on a Paid Service may change from time to time, including when content within a Paid Service becomes limited or unavailable due to restrictions from our partners who license us that content, or for legal or policy reasons.

*   For rentals of content: if content becomes removed or unavailable during your rental period, you will be entitled to either a refund or to a reasonable replacement.
*   For purchased content: (a) if the content becomes removed or unavailable during the first five years after your purchase, you will be entitled to a refund or a reasonable replacement or (b) if the content becomes removed or unavailable following such five year period, and you are not able to download a copy of the affected content before it becomes unavailable (if applicable), then we may, at our option, offer you either a reasonable replacement of the content or a full or partial refund of the price of the content.

### **7.3        Changes to Pricing**

Prices for Paid Services may change from time to time, for example, to reflect inflation, changes in pricing from our licensors, changes for promotional offerings, changes to the Paid Services or changing business needs. Google does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. Any changes to pricing for Paid Services with recurring payments will only apply following reasonable notice to you. If we notify you of a price change for a Paid Service with a recurring payment and you do not want to continue that Paid Service at the new price, you can cancel the Paid Service before the start of the next subscription period in which the new price applies, by following the steps in Section 4 (Cancellation of Subscriptions).

### **7.4        Changes to this Agreement**

Google may change these Paid Service Terms, for example,  (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business, e.g., when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, safety or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change the Paid Service Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice  (except when we launch a new product or feature or in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements) and an opportunity to cancel any subscriptions. The new Paid Service Terms will be effective after such notice period. Your continued use of a Paid Service following such notice period will indicate your acceptance of the new Paid Service Terms. The new terms will apply to your use of all Paid Service content (including content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases. If you do not agree to such changes then (i) please cancel any subscriptions you have purchased before the end of the notice period and (ii) you may not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest version of the Paid Service Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased Paid Services.

**8\.         Communications**
------------------------------

By using the Paid Services, you consent to receiving communications from us including marketing communications such as newsletters about YouTube features and content, special offers, promotional announcements, and customer surveys, to your registered email address or via other methods. If you no longer want to receive such communications, go to the "Notifications" tab within the "YouTube Settings" page of our [website](https://www.youtube.com/account) to manage your YouTube communications. Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) for further details.

**9.        Primetime Channels**
--------------------------------

**9.1        Introduction**

Google may make available subscription services from different content partners as part of the YouTube Primetime offering (each a "**Primetime Channel**"). Each Primetime Channel is offered as an independent subscription separate from any other Primetime Channel(s) and content purchases or subscriptions you may have, including without limitation, your YouTube Premium subscription. YouTube Premium enables access to certain premium features or content that may not be available to you on a Primetime Channel. You must be at least the age of majority in your region to subscribe to a Primetime Channel.

**9.2**        **Primetime Content**

Occasionally, the content made available on Primetime Channels via the Service may be different from the content made available on the same channel, when subscribed to directly with the content partner. This is due to legal or policy reasons, including our partners’ licensing rights and YouTube’s Community Guidelines. If a Primetime Channel's content becomes unavailable on the Service, you may request a partial refund for the unavailable/affected content.

Google’s content partners have discretion over the programming they include in each of their Primetime Channels and may modify programs, program elements, promotional or other materials at any time.

Google will monitor usage and protect content on the Primetime Channels from piracy, unauthorized access, distribution, or use through content protection systems and related software applications designed to withstand circumvention. Any reported or reasonably suspected circumvention may result in termination of your subscription and/or Google account.

**9.3**        **Cancellation**

Each of your subscriptions for an individual Primetime Channel is separate from any other Primetime Channel subscriptions you may have and may be cancelled by you independently from any other Primetime Channel subscriptions, as set out in Section 4.1. Primetime Channels subscribed to as part of a bundle of Primetime Channels may only be cancelled by cancelling the bundle of Primetime Channels in its entirety.

**9.4        Accessing Content**
--------------------------------

You may access each Primetime Channel on a limited number of devices at the same time, as described in the [Primetime Channels Help Centre article](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12827998?ref_topic=12462664). When the device limitation is reached, you may not access a Primetime Channel on additional devices.

**9.5        Ads**
------------------

The ad experience for each Primetime Channel may be different from what you see elsewhere on the Service and on other Primetime Channels, for example, the frequency of ads or length of ad breaks. YouTube Premium members may still see ads on Primetime Channels.

**9.6        Prohibitions**
---------------------------

**The Primetime Channels may include trademarks, graphics, logos, scripts, and sounds that belong to the Primetime Channel content partners. You may not use, copy, download or otherwise exploit any of these materials displayed through the Service, except as expressly authorised by these Terms.**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**10****.        Consumer rights**

Applicable law in some jurisdictions may give You consumer rights which cannot be limited by contract.  Nothing in these Terms, including sections dealing with refunds and replacements, restricts those rights.

**11.        Other Terms**
--------------------------

**11****.1**        The Paid Services include content uploaded or otherwise submitted by our users and partners. If you see any content which you believe does not comply with our Community Guidelines, please notify us by following the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

**11****.2**        You can contact our customer support team by clicking “Help” next to the relevant purchase on your [Purchases page](https://www.youtube.com/purchases) (for one-time purchases) or by [contacting the team](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_contact)[.](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_contact) Complaints and/or feedback about your Paid Service experience may also be sent to Google at the addresses listed in the first section (marked with “Attn: YouTube Paid Services”).

**11****.3**        To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on third-party applications. Learn more about [keeping your Google account secure](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/46526), including what to do if you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google account.

**11****.4**        Your transaction for the Paid Service is with Google Digital Inc.

**11****.5**         The provisions of the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) (including those relating to governing law and limitation of liability) apply to your use of the YouTube Paid Services. If there is a conflict between the YouTube Terms of Service and these Paid Service Terms, the Paid Service Terms will take precedence.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.youtube.com/t/policy_cns

### What is a collecting society?

A collecting society is an organization that licenses and manages copyrighted works on behalf of copyright owners.

Songwriters and composers become members of collecting societies to collect royalties from use of their works. Collecting societies monitor performances and distribution of the works on radio, television, in public venues, and online.

### How do collecting societies work?

Collecting societies typically operate in a particular country/region. The society enters into various agreements with collecting societies in other countries/regions. These agreements decide how royalties that are earned in one country/region are paid to the songwriters and composers in another.

**Example**: A songwriter from Brazil might collect royalties when a cover band plays their song in a pub in London. The songwriter might also earn royalties when a fan shares an online video of themselves covering the song.

### How do collecting societies affect YouTube Creators?

You might get a notice that one of your videos may include copyrighted content administered by "Music Publishing Rights Collecting Society" or “one or more music publishing rights collecting societies.” It means YouTube's [Content ID](http://youtube.com/t/contentid) system found one or more musical compositions in your video and collecting societies may claim a portion of the rights.

### As a YouTube Creator, what actions can I take?

If you get a collecting society notice and believe your video was claimed in error, listen to your video again and ask yourself:

*   Is there music in the background?
*   Was someone singing or playing a cover version of a song?

If the answer is yes to either question, then these uses of a copyrighted work often require royalties be paid to the songwriter or composer.

If you're certain no copyrighted work is included in your video, intentionally or unintentionally, you can [dispute the claim](https://www.youtube.com/youtube/answer/2797454#how).

If you dispute a claim without a valid reason, the content owner may request a take down of your video. If we get a valid takedown request for your video, your account will get a copyright strike. Learn more about [copyright strikes](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000).

Sorry about that

**Reservation**

Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.

**Develop, Improve and Update** **the Service**

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user.  When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) subject to applicable law and policies.  

**Your Content and Conduct**
----------------------------

**Uploading Content**

If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines)) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.

**Rights you Grant**

You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.

**License to YouTube**

By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates’) business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.

**License to Other Users**

You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.

**Duration of License**

The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.

**Right to Monetize**

You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.

**Removing Your Content**

You may [remove your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770) from the Service at any time. You also have the option to [make a copy of your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100) before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.

**Removal of Content By YouTube**

If we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the [Troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024) page of our Help Center.

**Community Guidelines Strikes**
--------------------------------

YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.  A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the [Community Guidelines Strikes Basics](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032) page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may [appeal here](https://studio.youtube.com/).

If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service.

**Copyright Protection**

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center). If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please [send us a notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center), where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.

**Account Suspension & Termination**
------------------------------------

## Terms of Service from: https://myaccount.google.com/privacypolicy?hl=en

Information Google collects
---------------------------

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which [ads you’ll find most useful](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-useful-ads), [the people who matter most to you online](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-people-online), or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with [unique identifiers](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-unique-id) tied to the browser, application, or [device](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-device) you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as [personal information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-personal-info).

Things you create or provide to us
----------------------------------

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/02-things-you-create-or-provide-to-us-lightmode.svg)

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with [personal information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-personal-info) that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a [phone number](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-phone-number) or [payment information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-payment-info) to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

Information we collect as you use our services
----------------------------------------------

### Your apps, browsers & devices

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/03-your-apps-browsers-devices-lightmode.svg)

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and [devices](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-devices) you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information we collect includes [unique identifiers](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-unique-id), browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including [IP address](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-ip), crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and [referrer URL](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-referrer-url) of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an [Android device with Google apps](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-android-device), your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your [device type and carrier name](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9021432?hl=en), crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, [other information about how you’re using your Android device](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en).

### Your activity

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/04-your-activity-lightmode.svg)

We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:

*   Terms you search for
*   Videos you watch
*   [Views and interactions with content and ads](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-content-views)
*   [Voice and audio information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-voice-audio-information)
*   Purchase activity
*   People with whom you communicate or share content
*   [Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-activity-on-third-party)
*   Chrome browsing history you’ve [synced with your Google Account](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-chrome-sync)

If you use our [services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-calls-messages), we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/0d6da8d8c44e7e3ee95c4d56c19f04e1.svg)

### Your location information

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/05-your-location-information-lightmode.svg)

We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.

Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:

*   GPS and other [sensor data from your device](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-sensor-data)
*   [IP address](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-ip)
*   [Activity on Google services](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-activity-on-services), such as from your searches or [places you label like home or work](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-places-you-label)
*   [Information about things near your device](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-near-device), such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can [turn your Android device’s location on or off](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_location&hl=en) using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on [Location History](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_lochistory&hl=en) if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about [how we use location information](https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data?hl=en).

* * *

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from [publicly accessible sources](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-sources). For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to [protect against abuse](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-against-abuse). We also receive information from partners to provide [advertising and research services on their behalf](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-ad-services).

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including [cookies](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-cookies), [pixel tags](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-pixel), local storage, such as [browser web storage](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-browser-storage) or [application data caches](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-application-data-cache), databases, and [server logs](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-server-logs).

Why Google collects data
------------------------

We use data to build better services
------------------------------------

We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:

### Provide our services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/06-provide-our-services-lightmode.svg)

We use your information to [deliver our services](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-deliver-services), like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.

### Maintain & improve our services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/07-maintain-improve-our-services-lightmode.svg)

We also use your information to [ensure our services are working as intended](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-ensure-working), such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to [make improvements](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-make-improvements) to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.

### Develop new services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/08-develop-new-services-lightmode.svg)

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.

### Provide personalized services, including content and ads

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/09-provide-personalized-services-lightmode.svg)

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and [customized search results](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-customized-search). For example, [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp&hl=en) provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you [personalized ads](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-personalized-ads) based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in [My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com/?hl=en).

*   We don’t show you personalized ads based on [sensitive categories](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-sensitive-categories), such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
*   We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
*   We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/900a793eae04f4bddd675f8d95c4a794.svg)

### Measure performance

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/10-measure-performance-lightmode.svg)

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to [link information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-link-info) about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.

### Communicate with you

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/11-communicate-with-you-lightmode.svg)

We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

### Protect Google, our users, and the public

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/pp_2024/12-protect-google-our-users-lightmode.svg)

We use information to help improve the [safety and reliability](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-safety-reliability) of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or [the public](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-the-public).

* * *

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us [detect abuse](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-detect-abuse) such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use [algorithms](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-algorithm) to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

We may [use the information we collect](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-combine-info) across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, [your activity on other sites and apps](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#footnote-other-sites) may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Key terms
---------

### Affiliates

An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Ltd, Google Payment Corp, and Google Dialer Inc. Learn more about the [companies providing business services in the EU](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/affiliates?hl=en).

### Algorithm

A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.

### Application data cache

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.

### Browser web storage

Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about [how Google uses cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en) and how Google uses data, including cookies, [when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en).

### Device

A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.

### Google Account

You may access some of our services by signing up for a [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en) and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.

### IP address

Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about [how we use location information.](https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data?hl=en)

### Non-personally identifiable information

This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.

### Personal information

This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.

### Pixel tag

A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.

### Referrer URL

A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.

### Sensitive personal information

This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.

### Server logs

Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:

123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -  
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -  
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -  
740674ce2123e969

*   `123.45.67.89` is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
*   `25/Mar/2003 10:15:32` is the date and time of the query.
*   `http://www.google.com/search?q=cars` is the requested URL, including the search query.
*   `Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7` is the browser and operating system being used.
*   `740674ce2123a969` is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).

### Unique identifiers

A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.

Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about [how Google uses cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en).

On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be [managed](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en) in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

Additional Context
------------------

### Activity on Google Services

If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.

In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.

You can view and control your Web & App Activity at [My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols?hl=en).

### activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services

Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.

This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.

You can [learn more](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en) about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.

### ads you’ll find most useful

For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more [about Google ads](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en) and [why you may see particular ads](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en).

For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.

### Android device with Google apps

Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about [Google Play Services](https://support.google.com/android/answer/10546414?hl=en).

### customized search results

For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can [learn more here](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_searchactivity&hl=en). You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can [search and browse privately](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_incognito&hl=en) or turn off [signed-out search personalization](https://www.google.com/history/optout?utm_source=pp&hl=en).

### deliver our services

Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:

*   We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
*   We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
*   Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/photos?p=privpol_manage&hl=en)
*   A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
*   When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.

### detect abuse

When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including [child sexual abuse and exploitation material](https://protectingchildren.google/?hl=en)), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.

### devices

For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.

### ensure and improve

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.

### ensure our services are working as intended

For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.

### Information about things near your device

If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_androidloc&hl=en)

### legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en).

### make improvements

For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.

### may link information

Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/analytics?p=privpol_data&hl=en)

### our users

For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/12158374?hl=en).

### partner with Google

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_controlads&hl=en)

### payment information

For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.

We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_agereq&hl=en)

### personalized ads

You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en)

### phone number

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_phone&hl=en)

### Places you label like home and work

You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your [Google Account.](https://myaccount.google.com/personal-info?hl=en)

### protect against abuse

For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).

### publicly accessible sources

For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

### rely on cookies to function properly

For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. [Learn more](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en#types-of-cookies)

### safety and reliability

Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:

*   Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
*   The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/mail?p=privpol_signinactivity&hl=en)

### sensitive categories

When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we [require the same from advertisers](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy?p=privpol_p13nad&hl=en) that use our services.

### Sensor data from your device

Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about [how we use location information.](https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data?hl=en)

### servers around the world

For example, we operate data centers located [around the world](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations?hl=en) to help keep our products continuously available for users.

### services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages

Examples of these services include:

*   Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
*   Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
*   Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
*   Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
*   Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
*   Google Fi, for a phone plan

### show trends

When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/trends?p=privpol_about&hl=en)

### similar information related to your physical or mental health

If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

### specific Google services

For example, you can delete [your blog](https://support.google.com/blogger?p=privpol_blog&hl=en) from Blogger or [a Google Site you own](https://support.google.com/sites?p=privpol_delete&hl=en) from Google Sites. You can also delete [reviews](https://support.google.com/googleplay?p=privpol_review&hl=en) you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.

### specific partners

For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. [Learn more](https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners?hl=en) about these partners and how they use your information.

### synced with your Google Account

Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/chrome?p=privpol_chrsync&hl=en)

### the people who matter most to you online

For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you [contact most frequently](https://contacts.google.com/?hl=en).

### the public

For example, we process information about [requests to remove content](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?visit_id=637939486089565735-343938859&hl=en) from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.

### third parties

For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.

### use the information we collect across our services

Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:

*   When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_privresults&hl=en)
*   If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=autocontacts&hl=en)
*   The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
*   If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/googlehome?p=privpol_actions&hl=en)
*   If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.

### Views and interactions with content and ads

For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.

### Voice and audio information

For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6030020?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-audio-recordings-are-saved)

### your activity on other sites and apps

This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your [account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en) and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

[Learn more](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en) about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive?hl=en) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en.pdf)

[Country version:](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-country-version) Australia

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_AU/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en).

Terms
-----

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google LLC  
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA

1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, California 94043  
USA

Age requirements
----------------

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en).

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/02-your-relationship-with-google-lightmode.svg)

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_AU/how-our-business-works).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/03-provide-a-broad-range-of-useful-services-lightmode.svg)

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Shopping)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/04-develop-improve-and-update-google-services-lightmode.svg)

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?hl=en) subject to applicable law and policies.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/05-follow-these-terms-and-service-specific-additional-terms-lightmode.svg)

The permission we give you to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/?hl=en), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/?hl=en), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/?hl=en). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/06-respect-others-lightmode.svg)

We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy?hl=en), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275?hl=en). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#taking-action)_ section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

*   introducing malware
*   spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
*   jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/?hl=en)
*   accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

*   phishing
*   creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
*   misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
*   providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

*   providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
*   using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
*   reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
*   using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
*   using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
*   hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
*   providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/07-permission-to-use-your-content-lightmode.svg)

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    *   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    *   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:
    *   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    *   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?ref=ps-terms&hl=en))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

Service-related communications
------------------------------

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions?hl=en) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/11-in-case-of-problems-or-disagreements-lightmode.svg)

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-warranty)_ section; (2) the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en); and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.

**Don’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.**

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-liability) — but not others — under these terms.

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for:

*   fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
*   death or personal injury caused by negligence
*   gross negligence
*   willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-organization):

*   To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
*   If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-liability):
    *   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    *   indirect or consequential loss
    *   punitive damages
*   Except as stated in the _[For all users](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#for-all)_ section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback?hl=en) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact?hl=en).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/12-about-these-terms-lightmode.svg)

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

Welcome to YouTube Paid Services!

**1.        Our Service**
-------------------------

Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform. YouTube enables access to certain premium features or content in exchange for one-time or recurring fees (each a "**Paid Service**"). The Paid Services include YouTube rentals and purchases, channel memberships, paid subscriptions, and other YouTube services which may be offered by Google.

### **1.1         Your Service Provider**

The entity providing the Paid Services is Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

We may use other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group, now or in the future (these companies are referred to as our “**Affiliates**”) to manage Paid Services.

Any payments you make for the Paid Services will be taken by Google Ireland Limited, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Together, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited, are "**Google, "we**", "**us**", or "**our**".

### **1.2         Applicable Terms**

Your transactions and any use of the Paid Services are subject to: these Paid Service Terms of Service; the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms); the [Paid Service Usage Rules](https://www.youtube.com/t/usage_paycontent); and the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). We’ll refer to these documents together as the “**Terms**”.

Please read the Terms carefully and make sure you understand them. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you may not use the Paid Services. Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order a subscription or an item of content), you will enter into a separate contract with us for that particular Paid Service and will be asked to accept the Paid Service Terms again.

**2.        Accessing Paid Services**
-------------------------------------

### **2.1         Age Requirements**

The age requirements in the YouTube Terms of Service also apply to your use of the Paid Services. You must also comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Paid Services (for example an age restriction on a movie).  Family managers and family members must meet these additional requirements as well.

### **2.2        Device Requirements and Usage Limits**

Certain Paid Services may require you to use a device that meets the system and compatibility requirements for that Paid Service, which may change from time to time. For further information on supported devices and technical requirements, visit our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_topic). There may also be limits on how you can access or use the different types of Paid Services on YouTube (e.g., applicable viewing periods and device limitations). Please see the [YouTube Paid Service Usage Rules](https://www.youtube.com/t/usage_paycontent) for more information.

### **2.3        Geographic Restrictions**

The Paid Services, and certain content available within the Paid Services, may only be available in certain countries. You agree that you will not present any false, inaccurate or misleading information in an effort to misrepresent your country of residence, and you will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Paid Services or content available within the Paid Services.

### **2.4        Other Google Paid Services**

In some cases, you may be able to access a Paid Service through other Google products (e.g., you may be able to watch a movie on Google Play that you purchased on YouTube).  Additionally, you may be able to access content via YouTube that you have purchased, or subscribed to, through other Google products (e.g. you may be able to watch a movie on YouTube that you purchased on Google Play).  Your use of any Paid Service is governed only by the Terms, and not the terms of any other Google product, including any other Google product through which you receive access to a Paid Service.

### **2.5         Your Information**

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Paid Services.  Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.

**3.        Payment and Free Trials**
-------------------------------------

### **3.1        Payment**

Google accepts payment via the payment method indicated prior to your purchase. You must have a valid, accepted payment method on file in order to purchase Paid Services, or to participate in no-cost trial offers or other no-cost offers related to the Paid Services. You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order. Google will charge your payment method for the price listed for the relevant Paid Service along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations. If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Service subscription, you agree that Google will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other reason, and Google is unable to charge you on the next billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Service until you update your payment method. Where possible, we will provide you with notice when this happens. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time following that notice, Google may cancel your subscription. In some cases, you may transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Service (e.g., if you subscribe to YouTube Premium using another platform like Apple or Google Play).  In these cases, such platform will charge your payment method and be responsible for managing any issues with your payment, including refunds.

### **3.2        Free Trials**

Google may offer free trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time. If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that includes a trial, you will receive access to that Paid Service for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period.

### **3.3        Discounts**

Google may, from time to time, offer discounts on purchases or subscriptions (such as a YouTube family plan or student plan). Additional terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, may apply to such plans and any such additional terms will be made available to you prior to purchase.  

### **3.4         Pre-Orders**

Google may offer the ability to pre-order certain items of content that are available within the Paid Services. When you place a pre-order, unless otherwise noted at the time, your payment method will not be charged until the date when the relevant item of content is made available to you. You can cancel a pre-order at any time up to the point at which the relevant item of content is made available. In some cases, Google may need to cancel a pre-order you have placed, in which case we will notify you.

### **3.5        Taxes**

If Google is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.

**4.        Cancellations and Refunds**
---------------------------------------

### **4.1        Cancellation of Subscriptions**

If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period. The cancellation will take effect at the end of that billing period. You will retain access to the Paid Service from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period and, unless otherwise indicated in the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy), you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.

### **4.2        Cancellation of Purchases or Rentals**

You can cancel your purchase and receive a refund as long as you have not commenced using the relevant Paid Service ordered and you make your request no later than 7 working days after your order is completed.  We reserve the right to approve or deny refund requests after 7 working days at our sole discretion, except where the Paid Service is defective, in which case the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy#zippy=%2cyoutube-premium-youtube-music-premium-memberships%2cmovie-show-purchases-or-rentals%2cticketed-live-events%2csuper-chat%2csuper-stickers%2csuper-thanks%2cdonations%2cchannel-memberships%2crefund-timelines) will apply. If you receive a refund for any reason, Google reserves the right to terminate your access to the relevant Paid Service purchased.

### **4.3        Refunds**

Google offers additional rights of refund for several types of Paid Services, including digital content, as set out in the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy).  

**5.        License**
---------------------

After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for a Paid Service, you may access and use that Paid Service, for your personal, non-commercial use only, and as long as you comply with the Terms and the law. Your license to the Paid Services (including any content offered through the Paid Services) is non-exclusive and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Google and its licensors. You agree not to use any Paid Service, in whole or in part, in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged (except where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement).

**6\.         Restrictions**
----------------------------

When you use the Paid Services, you may not (or attempt to):

*   use the Paid Services in an illegal manner, or for an illegal purpose;
*   share your Google account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid Service they did not order;
*   copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the Paid Services to any third party;
*   circumvent, reverse engineer, modify, disable, or otherwise tamper with any security technology that Google uses to protect the Paid Services or encourage or help anyone else to do so;
*   access the Paid Services other than by means authorized by Google; or
*   remove any proprietary notices or labels on Paid Services (for example watermarks).

**7.        Changes**
---------------------

### **7.1        Changes to the Paid Services**

We’re constantly developing new features and ways to improve our services and we may modify the Service (including the Paid Services) as set out in the YouTube Terms of Service. Changes to a Paid Service will not affect your ability to request a refund as described above.

### **7.2        Removal or Unavailability of Content**

The availability of content on a Paid Service may change from time to time, including when content within a Paid Service becomes limited or unavailable due to restrictions from our partners who license us that content, or for legal or policy reasons.

*   For rentals of content: if content becomes removed or unavailable during your rental period, you will be entitled to either a refund or to a reasonable replacement.
*   For purchased content: (a) if the content becomes removed or unavailable during the first five years after your purchase, you will be entitled to a refund or a reasonable replacement or (b) if the content becomes removed or unavailable following such five year period, and you are not able to download a copy of the affected content before it becomes unavailable (if applicable), then we may, at our option, offer you either a reasonable replacement of the content or a full or partial refund of the price of the content.

### **7.3        Changes to Pricing**

Prices for Paid Services may change from time to time, for example, to reflect inflation, changes in pricing from our licensors, changes for promotional offerings, changes to the Paid Services or changing business needs. Google does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. Any changes to pricing for Paid Services with recurring payments will only apply following reasonable notice to you. If we notify you of a price change for a Paid Service with a recurring payment and you do not want to continue that Paid Service at the new price, you can cancel the Paid Service before the start of the next subscription period in which the new price applies, by following the steps in Section 4 (Cancellation of Subscriptions).

### **7.4        Changes to this Agreement**

Google may change these Paid Service Terms, for example,  (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business, e.g., when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, safety or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change the Paid Service Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice  (except when we launch a new product or feature or in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements) and an opportunity to cancel any subscriptions. The new Paid Service Terms will be effective after such notice period. Your continued use of a Paid Service following such notice period will indicate your acceptance of the new Paid Service Terms. The new terms will apply to your use of all Paid Service content (including content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases. If you do not agree to such changes then (i) please cancel any subscriptions you have purchased before the end of the notice period and (ii) you may not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest version of the Paid Service Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased Paid Services.

**8\.         Communications**
------------------------------

By using the Paid Services, you consent to receiving communications from us including marketing communications such as newsletters about YouTube features and content, special offers, promotional announcements, and customer surveys, to your registered email address or via other methods.

Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) for further details.

**9.        Primetime Channels**
--------------------------------

**9.1        Introduction**

Google may make available subscription services from different content partners as part of the YouTube Primetime offering (each a "**Primetime Channel**"). Each Primetime Channel is offered as an independent subscription separate from any other Primetime Channel(s) and content purchases or subscriptions you may have, including without limitation, your YouTube Premium subscription. YouTube Premium enables access to certain premium features or content that may not be available to you on a Primetime Channel. You must be at least the age of majority in your region to subscribe to a Primetime Channel.

**9.2**        **Primetime Content**

Occasionally, the content made available on Primetime Channels via the Service may be different from the content made available on the same channel, when subscribed to directly with the content partner. This is due to legal or policy reasons, including our partners’ licensing rights and YouTube’s Community Guidelines. If a Primetime Channel's content becomes unavailable on the Service, you may request a partial refund for the unavailable/affected content.

Google’s content partners have discretion over the programming they include in each of their Primetime Channels and may modify programs, program elements, promotional or other materials at any time.

Google will monitor usage and protect content on the Primetime Channels from piracy, unauthorized access, distribution, or use through content protection systems and related software applications designed to withstand circumvention. Any reported or reasonably suspected circumvention may result in termination of your subscription and/or Google account.

**9.3**        **Cancellation**

Each of your subscriptions for an individual Primetime Channel is separate from any other Primetime Channel subscriptions you may have and may be cancelled by you independently from any other Primetime Channel subscriptions, as set out in Section 4.1. Primetime Channels subscribed to as part of a bundle of Primetime Channels may only be cancelled by cancelling the bundle of Primetime Channels in its entirety.

**9.4        Accessing Content**
--------------------------------

You may access each Primetime Channel on a limited number of devices at the same time, as described in the [Primetime Channels Help Centre article](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12827998?ref_topic=12462664). When the device limitation is reached, you may not access a Primetime Channel on additional devices.

**9.5        Ads**
------------------

The ad experience for each Primetime Channel may be different from what you see elsewhere on the Service and on other Primetime Channels, for example, the frequency of ads or length of ad breaks. YouTube Premium members may still see ads on Primetime Channels.

**9.6        Prohibitions**
---------------------------

**The Primetime Channels may include trademarks, graphics, logos, scripts, and sounds that belong to the Primetime Channel content partners. You may not use, copy, download or otherwise exploit any of these materials displayed through the Service, except as expressly authorised by these Terms.**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**10****.        Consumer rights**

Applicable law in some jurisdictions may give You consumer rights which cannot be limited by contract.  Nothing in these Terms, including sections dealing with refunds and replacements, restricts those rights.

**11.        Other Terms**
--------------------------

**11****.1**        The Paid Services include content uploaded or otherwise submitted by our users and partners. If you see any content which you believe does not comply with our Community Guidelines, please notify us by following the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

**11****.2**        You can contact our customer support team by clicking “Help” next to the relevant purchase on your [Purchases page](https://www.youtube.com/purchases) (for one-time purchases) or by [contacting the team](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_contact)[.](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_contact) Complaints and/or feedback about your Paid Service experience may also be sent to Google at the addresses listed in the first section (marked with “Attn: YouTube Paid Services”).

**11****.3**        To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on third-party applications. Learn more about [keeping your Google account secure](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/46526), including what to do if you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google account.

**11****.4**        Your transaction for the Paid Service is with Google Ireland Limited.

**11****.5**         The provisions of the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) (including those relating to governing law and limitation of liability) apply to your use of the YouTube Paid Services. If there is a conflict between the YouTube Terms of Service and these Paid Service Terms, the Paid Service Terms will take precedence.

Welcome to YouTube Paid Services!

**1.        Our Service**
-------------------------

Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform. YouTube enables access to certain premium features or content in exchange for one-time or recurring fees (each a "**Paid Service**"). The Paid Services include YouTube rentals and purchases, channel memberships, paid subscriptions, and other YouTube services which may be offered by Google.

### **1.1         Your Service Provider**

The entity providing the Paid Services is Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

We may use other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group, now or in the future (these companies are referred to as our “**Affiliates**”) to manage Paid Services.

Any payments you make for the Paid Services will be taken by Google Ireland Limited, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Together, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited, are "**Google, "we**", "**us**", or "**our**".

### **1.2         Applicable Terms**

Your transactions and any use of the Paid Services are subject to: these Paid Service Terms of Service; the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms); the [Paid Service Usage Rules](https://www.youtube.com/t/usage_paycontent); and the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). We’ll refer to these documents together as the “**Terms**”.

Please read the Terms carefully and make sure you understand them. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you may not use the Paid Services. Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order a subscription or an item of content), you will enter into a separate contract with us for that particular Paid Service and will be asked to accept the Paid Service Terms again.

**2.        Accessing Paid Services**
-------------------------------------

### **2.1         Age Requirements**

The age requirements in the YouTube Terms of Service also apply to your use of the Paid Services. You must also comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Paid Services (for example an age restriction on a movie).  Family managers and family members must meet these additional requirements as well.

### **2.2        Device Requirements and Usage Limits**

Certain Paid Services may require you to use a device that meets the system and compatibility requirements for that Paid Service, which may change from time to time. For further information on supported devices and technical requirements, visit our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_topic). There may also be limits on how you can access or use the different types of Paid Services on YouTube (e.g., applicable viewing periods and device limitations). Please see the [YouTube Paid Service Usage Rules](https://www.youtube.com/t/usage_paycontent) for more information.

### **2.3        Geographic Restrictions**

The Paid Services, and certain content available within the Paid Services, may only be available in certain countries. You agree that you will not present any false, inaccurate or misleading information in an effort to misrepresent your country of residence, and you will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Paid Services or content available within the Paid Services.

### **2.4        Other Google Paid Services**

In some cases, you may be able to access a Paid Service through other Google products (e.g., you may be able to watch a movie on Google Play that you purchased on YouTube).  Additionally, you may be able to access content via YouTube that you have purchased, or subscribed to, through other Google products (e.g. you may be able to watch a movie on YouTube that you purchased on Google Play).  Your use of any Paid Service is governed only by the Terms, and not the terms of any other Google product, including any other Google product through which you receive access to a Paid Service.

### **2.5         Your Information**

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Paid Services.  Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.

**3.        Payment and Free Trials**
-------------------------------------

### **3.1        Payment**

Google accepts payment via the payment method indicated prior to your purchase. You must have a valid, accepted payment method on file in order to purchase Paid Services, or to participate in no-cost trial offers or other no-cost offers related to the Paid Services. You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order. Google will charge your payment method for the price listed for the relevant Paid Service along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations. If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Service subscription, you agree that Google will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other reason, and Google is unable to charge you on the next billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Service until you update your payment method. Where possible, we will provide you with notice when this happens. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time following that notice, Google may cancel your subscription. In some cases, you may transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Service (e.g., if you subscribe to YouTube Premium using another platform like Apple or Google Play).  In these cases, such platform will charge your payment method and be responsible for managing any issues with your payment, including refunds.

### **3.2        Free Trials**

Google may offer free trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time. If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that includes a trial, you will receive access to that Paid Service for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period.

### **3.3        Discounts**

Google may, from time to time, offer discounts on purchases or subscriptions (such as a YouTube family plan or student plan). Additional terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, may apply to such plans and any such additional terms will be made available to you prior to purchase.  

### **3.4         Pre-Orders**

Google may offer the ability to pre-order certain items of content that are available within the Paid Services. When you place a pre-order, unless otherwise noted at the time, your payment method will not be charged until the date when the relevant item of content is made available to you. You can cancel a pre-order at any time up to the point at which the relevant item of content is made available. In some cases, Google may need to cancel a pre-order you have placed, in which case we will notify you.

### **3.5        Taxes**

If Google is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.

**4.        Cancellations and Refunds**
---------------------------------------

### **4.1        Cancellation of Subscriptions**

If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period. The cancellation will take effect at the end of that billing period. You will retain access to the Paid Service from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period and, unless otherwise indicated in the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy), you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.

### **4.2        Cancellation of Purchases or Rentals**

You can cancel your purchase and receive a refund as long as you have not commenced using the relevant Paid Service ordered and you make your request no later than 7 working days after your order is completed.  We reserve the right to approve or deny refund requests after 7 working days at our sole discretion, except where the Paid Service is defective, in which case the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy) will apply. If you receive a refund for any reason, Google reserves the right to terminate your access to the relevant Paid Service purchased.

### **4.3        Refunds**

Google offers additional rights of refund for several types of Paid Services, including digital content, as set out in the [Refund Policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=refund_policy).  

**5.        License**
---------------------

After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for a Paid Service, you may access and use that Paid Service, for your personal, non-commercial use only, and as long as you comply with the Terms and the law. Your license to the Paid Services (including any content offered through the Paid Services) is non-exclusive and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Google and its licensors. You agree not to use any Paid Service, in whole or in part, in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged (except where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement).

**6\.         Restrictions**
----------------------------

When you use the Paid Services, you may not (or attempt to):

*   use the Paid Services in an illegal manner, or for an illegal purpose;
*   share your Google account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid Service they did not order;

**7.        Changes**
---------------------

### **7.1        Changes to the Paid Services**

### **7.2        Removal or Unavailability of Content**

The availability of content on a Paid Service may change from time to time, including when content within a Paid Service becomes limited or unavailable due to restrictions from our partners who license us that content, or for legal or policy reasons.

*   For rentals of content: if content becomes removed or unavailable during your rental period, you will be entitled to either a refund or to a reasonable replacement.
*   For purchased content: (a) if the content becomes removed or unavailable during the first five years after your purchase, you will be entitled to a refund or a reasonable replacement or (b) if the content becomes removed or unavailable following such five year period, and you are not able to download a copy of the affected content before it becomes unavailable (if applicable), then we may, at our option, offer you either a reasonable replacement of the content or a full or partial refund of the price of the content.

### **7.3        Changes to Pricing**

Prices for Paid Services may change from time to time, for example, to reflect inflation, changes in pricing from our licensors, changes for promotional offerings, changes to the Paid Services or changing business needs. Google does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. Any changes to pricing for Paid Services with recurring payments will only apply following reasonable notice to you. If we notify you of a price change for a Paid Service with a recurring payment and you do not want to continue that Paid Service at the new price, you can cancel the Paid Service before the start of the next subscription period in which the new price applies, by following the steps in Section 4 (Cancellation of Subscriptions).

### **7.4        Changes to this Agreement**

Google may change these Paid Service Terms, for example,  (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business, e.g., when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, safety or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change the Paid Service Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice  (except when we launch a new product or feature or in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements) and an opportunity to cancel any subscriptions. The new Paid Service Terms will be effective after such notice period. Your continued use of a Paid Service following such notice period will indicate your acceptance of the new Paid Service Terms. The new terms will apply to your use of all Paid Service content (including content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases. If you do not agree to such changes then (i) please cancel any subscriptions you have purchased before the end of the notice period and (ii) you may not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest version of the Paid Service Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased Paid Services.

### **7.4        Changes to this Agreement**

Google may change these Paid Service Terms, for example,  (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business, e.g., when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, safety or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change the Paid Service Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice  (except when we launch a new product or feature or in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements) and an opportunity to cancel any subscriptions. The new Paid Service Terms will be effective after such notice period. Your continued use of a Paid Service following such notice period will indicate your acceptance of the new Paid Service Terms. The new terms will apply to your use of all Paid Service content (including content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases. If you do not agree to such changes then (i) please cancel any subscriptions you have purchased before the end of the notice period and (ii) you may not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest version of the Paid Service Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased Paid Services.

**8\.         Communications**
------------------------------

By using the Paid Services, you consent to receiving communications from us including marketing communications such as newsletters about YouTube features and content, special offers, promotional announcements, and customer surveys, to your registered email address or via other methods. If you no longer want to receive such communications, go to the "Notifications" tab within the "YouTube Settings" page of our [website](https://www.youtube.com/account) to manage your YouTube communications. Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) for further details.

**9.        Primetime Channels**
--------------------------------

**9.1        Introduction**

Google may make available subscription services from different content partners as part of the YouTube Primetime offering (each a "**Primetime Channel**"). Each Primetime Channel is offered as an independent subscription separate from any other Primetime Channel(s) and content purchases or subscriptions you may have, including without limitation, your YouTube Premium subscription. YouTube Premium enables access to certain premium features or content that may not be available to you on a Primetime Channel. You must be at least the age of majority in your region to subscribe to a Primetime Channel.

**9.2**        **Primetime Content**

Occasionally, the content made available on Primetime Channels via the Service may be different from the content made available on the same channel, when subscribed to directly with the content partner. This is due to legal or policy reasons, including our partners’ licensing rights and YouTube’s Community Guidelines. If a Primetime Channel's content becomes unavailable on the Service, you may request a partial refund for the unavailable/affected content.

Google’s content partners have discretion over the programming they include in each of their Primetime Channels and may modify programs, program elements, promotional or other materials at any time.

Google will monitor usage and protect content on the Primetime Channels from piracy, unauthorized access, distribution, or use through content protection systems and related software applications designed to withstand circumvention. Any reported or reasonably suspected circumvention may result in termination of your subscription and/or Google account.

**9.3**        **Cancellation**

Each of your subscriptions for an individual Primetime Channel is separate from any other Primetime Channel subscriptions you may have and may be cancelled by you independently from any other Primetime Channel subscriptions, as set out in Section 4.1. Primetime Channels subscribed to as part of a bundle of Primetime Channels may only be cancelled by cancelling the bundle of Primetime Channels in its entirety.

**9.4        Accessing Content**
--------------------------------

You may access each Primetime Channel on a limited number of devices at the same time, as described in the [Primetime Channels Help Centre article](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12827998?ref_topic=12462664). When the device limitation is reached, you may not access a Primetime Channel on additional devices.

**9.5        Ads**
------------------

The ad experience for each Primetime Channel may be different from what you see elsewhere on the Service and on other Primetime Channels, for example, the frequency of ads or length of ad breaks. YouTube Premium members may still see ads on Primetime Channels.

**9.6        Prohibitions**
---------------------------

**The Primetime Channels may include trademarks, graphics, logos, scripts, and sounds that belong to the Primetime Channel content partners. You may not use, copy, download or otherwise exploit any of these materials displayed through the Service, except as expressly authorised by these Terms.**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**10****.        Consumer rights**

Applicable law in some jurisdictions may give You consumer rights which cannot be limited by contract.  Nothing in these Terms, including sections dealing with refunds and replacements, restricts those rights.

**11.        Other Terms**
--------------------------

**11****.1**        The Paid Services include content uploaded or otherwise submitted by our users and partners. If you see any content which you believe does not comply with our Community Guidelines, please notify us by following the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

**11****.2**        You can contact our customer support team by clicking “Help” next to the relevant purchase on your [Purchases page](https://www.youtube.com/purchases) (for one-time purchases) or by [contacting the team](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_contact)[.](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=commerce_contact) Complaints and/or feedback about your Paid Service experience may also be sent to Google at the addresses listed in the first section (marked with “Attn: YouTube Paid Services”).

**11****.3**        To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on third-party applications. Learn more about [keeping your Google account secure](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/46526), including what to do if you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google account.

**11****.4**        Your transaction for the Paid Service is with Google Digital Inc.

**11****.5**         The provisions of the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) (including those relating to governing law and limitation of liability) apply to your use of the YouTube Paid Services. If there is a conflict between the YouTube Terms of Service and these Paid Service Terms, the Paid Service Terms will take precedence.

The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “**YouTube**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).

**Applicable Terms  
**Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) and the [Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies](https://www.youtube.com/t/policies) which may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the [Advertising on YouTube Policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/30084?ref_topic=2972865) if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the Agreement.

**Reservation**

Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.

**Develop, Improve and Update** **the Service**

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user.  When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) subject to applicable law and policies.  

**Your Content and Conduct**
----------------------------

**Uploading Content**

If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines)) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.

**Rights you Grant**

You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.

**License to YouTube**

By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates’) business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.

**License to Other Users**

You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.

**Duration of License**

The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.

**Right to Monetize**

You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.

**Removing Your Content**

You may [remove your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770) from the Service at any time. You also have the option to [make a copy of your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100) before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.

**Removal of Content By YouTube**

If we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the [Troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024) page of our Help Center.

**Community Guidelines Strikes**
--------------------------------

YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.  A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the [Community Guidelines Strikes Basics](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032) page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may [appeal here](https://studio.youtube.com/).

If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service.

**Copyright Protection**

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center). If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please [send us a notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center), where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.

**Account Suspension & Termination**
------------------------------------

**Terminations by You  
**You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these [instructions](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account) to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.

**Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube**

YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.  

**Notice for Termination or Suspension**

We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.

**Effect of Account Suspension or Termination**

If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your that the termination or suspension has been made in error, you can [appeal using this form](https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube).

**About Software in the Service**
---------------------------------

**Downloadable Software  
**When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.

**Open Source  
**Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

**Indemnity**

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your unlawful use of and access to the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party, in each case except to the extent caused by Google’s negligence, willful misconduct or breach.

**Third-Party Links  
**The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services. Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each third-party website and online service that you visit.

**About this Agreement**
------------------------

**Changing** **this Agreement**We may change this Agreement, for example (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business - for example, when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change this Agreement, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new product or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.

 **Appendix** **2****:** **Security Measures**
----------------------------------------------

As from the Terms Effective Date, Google will implement and maintain the Security Measures set out in this Appendix 2. Google may update or modify such Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Processor Services.

### 1\.         **Data Centre & Network Security**

(a) Data Centres.

Infrastructure. Google maintains geographically distributed data centres. Google stores all production data in physically secure data centres.

Redundancy. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimise the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Processor Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer's or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data centre equipment is scheduled through a standard process according to documented procedures.

Power. The data centre electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data centre. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data centre, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the diesel generator systems take over. The diesel generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data centre at full capacity typically for a period of days.

Server Operating Systems. Google servers use hardened operating systems which are customised for the unique server needs of the business. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the security of the code used to provide the Processor Services and enhance the security products in production environments.

Businesses Continuity. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.

(b) Networks & Transmission.

Data Transmission. Data centres are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centres. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during electronic transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.

External Attack Surface. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.

Intrusion Detection. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s intrusion detection involves:

1\. Tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;

2\. Employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and

3\. Employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.

Incident Response. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.

Encryption Technologies. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimise the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.

### 2\.         **Access and Site Controls**

(a) Site Controls.

On-site Data Centre Security Operation. Google’s data centres maintain an on-site security operation responsible for all physical data centre security functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operation personnel monitor Closed Circuit TV (“**CCTV**”) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and external patrols of the data centre regularly.

Data Centre Access Procedures. Google maintains formal access procedures for allowing physical access to the data centres. The data centres are housed in facilities that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants to the data centre are required to identify themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorised employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centres. Only authorised employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these facilities. Data centre electronic card key access requests must be made in advance and in writing, and require the approval of the requestor’s manager and the data centre director. All other entrants requiring temporary data centre access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from the data centre managers for the specific data centre and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data centre access record identifying the individual as approved.

On-site Data Centre Security Devices. Google’s data centres employ an electronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorised activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorised access throughout the business operations and data centres is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centres are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centres. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data centre building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables throughout the data centres connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on-site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for at least 7 days based on activity.

(b) Access Control.

Infrastructure Security Personnel. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Processor Services, and responding to security incidents.

Access Control and Privilege Management. Customer's administrators and users must authenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to use the Processor Services.

Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy. Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorised persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorised persons to access data they are authorised to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralised access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilising SSH certificates are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimise the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g. login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.

### 3\.         **Data**

(a) Data Storage, Isolation & Authentication.

Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. Data, the Processor Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centres. Google logically isolates each customer's data. A central authentication system is used across all Processor Services to increase uniform security of data.

(b) Decommissioned Disks and Disk Destruction Guidelines.

Certain disks containing data may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be decommissioned (“**Decommissioned Disk**”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes (the “**Data** **Destruction Guidelines**”) before leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance with the Data Destruction Guidelines.

### 4\.         **Personnel Security**

Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations.

Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Personal Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Google’s personnel will not process Customer Personal Data without authorisation.

### 5\.         **Subprocessor Security**

Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor then, subject always to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement), the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.

 **Appendix** **2****:** **Security Measures**
----------------------------------------------

As from the Terms Effective Date, Google will implement and maintain the Security Measures set out in this Appendix 2. Google may update or modify such Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Processor Services.

### 1\.         **Data Centre & Network Security**

(a) Data Centres.

Infrastructure. Google maintains geographically distributed data centres. Google stores all production data in physically secure data centres.

Redundancy. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimise the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Processor Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer's or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data centre equipment is scheduled through a standard process according to documented procedures.

Power. The data centre electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data centre. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data centre, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the diesel generator systems take over. The diesel generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data centre at full capacity typically for a period of days.

Server Operating Systems. Google servers use hardened operating systems which are customised for the unique server needs of the business. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the security of the code used to provide the Processor Services and enhance the security products in production environments.

Businesses Continuity. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.

(b) Networks & Transmission.

Data Transmission. Data centres are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centres. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during electronic transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.

External Attack Surface. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.

Intrusion Detection. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s intrusion detection involves:

1\. Tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;

2\. Employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and

3\. Employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.

Incident Response. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.

Encryption Technologies. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimise the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.

### 2\.         **Access and Site Controls**

(a) Site Controls.

On-site Data Centre Security Operation. Google’s data centres maintain an on-site security operation responsible for all physical data centre security functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operation personnel monitor Closed Circuit TV (“**CCTV**”) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and external patrols of the data centre regularly.

Data Centre Access Procedures. Google maintains formal access procedures for allowing physical access to the data centres. The data centres are housed in facilities that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants to the data centre are required to identify themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorised employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centres. Only authorised employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these facilities. Data centre electronic card key access requests must be made in advance and in writing, and require the approval of the requestor’s manager and the data centre director. All other entrants requiring temporary data centre access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from the data centre managers for the specific data centre and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data centre access record identifying the individual as approved.

On-site Data Centre Security Devices. Google’s data centres employ an electronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorised activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorised access throughout the business operations and data centres is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centres are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centres. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data centre building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables throughout the data centres connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on-site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for at least 7 days based on activity.

(b) Access Control.

Infrastructure Security Personnel. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Processor Services, and responding to security incidents.

Access Control and Privilege Management. Customer's administrators and users must authenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to use the Processor Services.

Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy. Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorised persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorised persons to access data they are authorised to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralised access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilising SSH certificates are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimise the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g. login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.

### 3\.         **Data**

(a) Data Storage, Isolation & Authentication.

Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. Data, the Processor Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centres. Google logically isolates each customer's data. A central authentication system is used across all Processor Services to increase uniform security of data.

(b) Decommissioned Disks and Disk Destruction Guidelines.

Certain disks containing data may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be decommissioned (“**Decommissioned Disk**”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes (the “**Data** **Destruction Guidelines**”) before leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance with the Data Destruction Guidelines.

### 4\.         **Personnel Security**

Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations.

Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Personal Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Google’s personnel will not process Customer Personal Data without authorisation.

### 5\.         **Subprocessor Security**

Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor then, subject always to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement), the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.

## Terms of Service from: https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/01-introduction-lightmode.svg)

Google Terms of Service
-----------------------

Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](https://policies.google.com/terms/archive?hl=en_US) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en.pdf)

[Country version:](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-country-version) Australia

What’s covered in these terms
-----------------------------

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_AU/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_US). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

*   [What you can expect from us](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
*   [What we expect from you](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
*   [Content in Google services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
*   [In case of problems or disagreements](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en_US). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US).

Terms
-----

Service provider
----------------

Google [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google LLC  
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA

1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, California 94043  
USA

Age requirements
----------------

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/02-your-relationship-with-google-lightmode.svg)

Your relationship with Google
-----------------------------

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_AU/how-our-business-works).

What you can expect from us
---------------------------

### Provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/03-provide-a-broad-range-of-useful-services-lightmode.svg)

We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

*   apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
*   platforms (like Google Shopping)
*   integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
*   devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/04-develop-improve-and-update-google-services-lightmode.svg)

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?hl=en_US) subject to applicable law and policies.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/05-follow-these-terms-and-service-specific-additional-terms-lightmode.svg)

The permission we give you to access and use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

*   **these terms**
*   **[service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en_US), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US), [Safety Center](https://safety.google/?hl=en_US), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/?hl=en_US), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](https://policies.google.com/?hl=en_US). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/06-respect-others-lightmode.svg)

We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

*   comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
*   respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
*   don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy?hl=en_US), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275?hl=en_US). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the _[Taking action in case of problems](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#taking-action)_ section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

*   introducing malware
*   spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
*   jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/?hl=en_US)
*   accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

*   phishing
*   creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
*   misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
*   providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

*   providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
*   using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
*   reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
*   using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
*   using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
*   hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
*   providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/07-permission-to-use-your-content-lightmode.svg)

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License
-------

[Your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

*   This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
*   This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    *   publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    *   feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _[Service-related communications](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-service-related-comm)_ section below.

### Scope

This license is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license

### Rights

This license allows Google to:

*   host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
*   publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
*   modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
*   sublicense these rights to:
    *   other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    *   our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _[Purpose](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-purpose)_ section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

*   **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    *   for spam, malware, and illegal content
    *   to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    *   to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?ref=ps-terms&hl=en_US))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
*   **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
*   **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

*   If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
*   If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

Using Google services
---------------------

Your Google Account
-------------------

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en_US) for your convenience. Some [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en_US).

Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

*   an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
*   your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/09-content-in-google-services-lightmode.svg)

Content in Google services
--------------------------

Your content
------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

*   See the _[Permission to use your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-permission)_ section for more about your rights in [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
*   See the _[Removing your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-removing)_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en_US) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US).

Google content
--------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions?hl=en_US) page.

Other content
-------------

Finally, some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/10-software-in-google-services-lightmode.svg)

Software in Google services
---------------------------

Some of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

*   worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
*   non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
*   royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
*   personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
*   non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/tos_2024/11-in-case-of-problems-or-disagreements-lightmode.svg)

In case of problems or disagreements
------------------------------------

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.

Warranty
--------

We provide our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this [warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-warranty), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

Disclaimers
-----------

The only commitments we make about our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the _[Warranty](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#toc-warranty)_ section; (2) the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US); and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.

**Don’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.**

Liabilities
-----------

### For all users

Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) — but not others — under these terms.

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for:

*   fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
*   death or personal injury caused by negligence
*   gross negligence
*   willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) or [organization](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization):

*   To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
*   If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
*   Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability):
    *   loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    *   indirect or consequential loss
    *   punitive damages
*   Except as stated in the _[For all users](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#for-all)_ section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

Taking action in case of problems
---------------------------------

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
*   compromise an investigation
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
*   we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback?hl=en_US) so that we can continue improving our services.

Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
--------------------------------------------

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact?hl=en_US).

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), or any related [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.

About these terms
-----------------

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

**Your Service Provider**

The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “**YouTube**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).

**Applicable Terms  
**Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) and the [Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies](https://www.youtube.com/t/policies) which may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the [Advertising on YouTube Policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/30084?ref_topic=2972865) if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the Agreement.

1.  access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders;

**Reservation**

Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.

**Develop, Improve and Update** **the Service**

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user.  When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using [Google Takeout,](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) subject to applicable law and policies.  

**Your Content and Conduct**
----------------------------

**Uploading Content**

If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines)) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.

**Rights you Grant**

You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.

**License to YouTube**

By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates’) business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.

**License to Other Users**

You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.

**Duration of License**

The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.

**Right to Monetize**

You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.

**Removing Your Content**

You may [remove your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770) from the Service at any time. You also have the option to [make a copy of your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100) before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.

**Removal of Content By YouTube**

If we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the [Troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024) page of our Help Center.

**Community Guidelines Strikes**
--------------------------------

YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines). Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.  A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the [Community Guidelines Strikes Basics](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032) page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may [appeal here](https://studio.youtube.com/).

If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service.

**Copyright Protection**

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center). If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please [send us a notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center), where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.

**Account Suspension & Termination**
------------------------------------

**Terminations by You  
**You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these [instructions](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account) to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.

**Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube**

The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/youtube/). Among other things, you can find out about [YouTube Kids](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/), the [YouTube Partner Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9223152) and [YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9223117) (where available).You can also read all about enjoying content on [other devices](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9257096?ref_topic=9257500) [like your television, your games console, or](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9257096?ref_topic=9257500) [Google Home](https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7029380).  

**Your Service Provider**

The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “**YouTube**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).

**Applicable Terms  
**Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) and the [Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9223153) which may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the [Advertising on YouTube Policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/30084?ref_topic=2972865) if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the Agreement.

Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.

**Who may use the Service?**

**You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service; however, children of all ages may use the Service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.

**Reservation**

Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.

**Changes to the Service**

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user.  Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make material changes to our Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, you understand and agree that there will be times when we make such changes without notice, such as where we feel we need to take action to improve the security and operability of our Service, prevent abuse, or comply with legal requirements.  

**Your Content and Conduct**
----------------------------

**Uploading Content**

If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the [YouTube Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines)) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.

**Rights you Grant**

You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.

**License to YouTube**

By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates’) business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.

**License to Other Users**

You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.

**Duration of License**

The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.

**Right to Monetize**

You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.

**Removing Your Content**

You may [remove your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770) from the Service at any time. You also have the option to [make a copy of your Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100) before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.

**Removal of Content By YouTube**

If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the [Troubleshooting](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024) page of our Help Center.

**Copyright Protection**

We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center). If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please [send us a notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our [YouTube Copyright Center](https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center), where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.

**Account Suspension & Termination**
------------------------------------

**Terminations by You  
**You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these [instructions](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account) to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.

**Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause**

YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.  

**Terminations by YouTube for Service** **Changes**

YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. 

**Notice for Termination or Suspension**

We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.

**Effect of Account Suspension or Termination**

If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can [appeal using this form](https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube).

This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement.
