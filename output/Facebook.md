Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT1Tw5mqX0ir0etev5ZW7JREOYB0iDx3iseQYJ-D60e9Ppq6UChNImVobH_VUGf3AKBx5uq79xLHTNYfytYsXtkpLmsanKTLOOrk67egJYlM1wuZE5CWlrZGmDoEbLTxVHzdpjMl02EQWa3-VdrphLOCLUw) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=0_overview

Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT3nKgu8KEL6su_u_7-OSbGFi0LKtifJRNOKgNixMbOGFixyN9Hd0vCYLZgOpUBs6HPNzxPnO10mNPKPpJyJn3RJowb_yTSHyn6yIjhBSrDibpXb8NLbkHOf_t62fYEw8RlzeHQmMoWW3bLMLheMuUalj8c) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  No third-party beneficiaries: These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  User name change: We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  Feedback: We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_1

Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT09LXidD63LsVx0dqytVL6KQ4OzkzGo_b2Zyig4ODnynCJUzlW_4Hw7-H56uOwlotzBEZLE95F4hXl3xISSVnqVAl_Ph2SXnx1cMCcGokURvBL-Ndyn9ci7izx63lyHdHLlsY4jL9yd9jJBWsYcwp-kJBk) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  No third-party beneficiaries: These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  User name change: We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  Feedback: We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_2

Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT2Q3VRU0iPIkP-axWY2blXg1yBT0Gk1lc--QLJFoNkgJ9WnvXT9MG4aNBQu_cNSu-4xnjMW2jmB8tmW6AtWRmPblFcDPP7r_X5Z1OaZ5fBoGOArZMdAupalCn1gIrSD1U12I0pSHCF435LGBNHGt5twPAQ) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  No third-party beneficiaries: These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  User name change: We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  Feedback: We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_3

Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT00AAZfXWj7DOLS1xOorYNi-OaJdVc6aLpzJm0vhXebrQpimafAarjvF7369ZG6B-7e9E3xZuznW9bSWNlfUku8HQRrzuNvFtLr_Yfu_Q_Z0R_RjDulOjQatWZamY2vE4zTG-y75MaJviGpm-UO-HluJAk) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  No third-party beneficiaries: These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  User name change: We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  Feedback: We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_4

Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT2b5KaH-VdDimt7Qen2mqAxwrJQBGHDNovM4v93uV8A80Hor21tEseE9NXerhuqdMDGsSfVNSx48oYl7btb0wCrPciAsai1nHbN9Y31mW6oovbS15BpOxhTYPODPNwAJLumb34rbsL01bPEaGk51c-e3jQ) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  No third-party beneficiaries: These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  User name change: We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  Feedback: We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5

Terms of Service
----------------

Overview

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oversightboard.com%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg), or [other terms and policies](https://www.facebook.com/terms/?section_id=section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

1\. Your content: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

2\. Permission to use content that you create and share: Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

3\. Deleting your content: You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

5\. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Four-trademarks%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT3HlOzpP5Ls4ybzR_oht3lJVSbO8y0ikbFRkn7TKHffSSR3f5KJioIh4eorXuLvlG0b75py2mp63u8hckBww-7l36Lgg-NmjIagUTMGK4fKW5ahg0QQyCUp-Jng0vcEq2iKge_cESX5QmGKaaxxCh_C3wg) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

4\. Additional provisions

4.1 Updating our Terms

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous

1.  Supplemental Terms: Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  Severability: If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  No transfer: You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  Legacy contact: You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  No third-party beneficiaries: These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  User name change: We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  Feedback: We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

## Terms of Service from: https://mbasic.facebook.com/legal/terms/plain_text_terms/

Overview
--------

Effective from 1 January 2025

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

[Return to top![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yC/r/si3BXjWAx4Y.png)](#)

1\. The services we provide
---------------------------

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:
----------------------------------------------

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:
------------------------------------------------------------------

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://www.oversightboard.com/).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:
----------------------------------------------

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:
------------------------------------

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded
-------------------------------

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

[Return to top![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yC/r/si3BXjWAx4Y.png)](#)

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community
--------------------------------------------------

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook
------------------------

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT0Y-KNG9U_ylbl4HmRp0nC2mBASQDARg552H5ww44ezP0fCF_tGhSSQPBMuqwYoKdQaO1tqlXBLQUz3IhZU6AkNr3yaw3Fwk9M35eAw0Xt4Il8UPnFhAuVjBlfYfdxnHZwJVG7X4vadAQXK2QAjpR1OFNY) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2_CXUv2NassfO5e4qP4027yi6xwGnlW8f_v8yXC6XDXB8iWW1U_8Dh2TV7qeBCzuYUBAfbo3A74C5qL1XghNTFZxUfGLdZJDaRL12a3iy_CcY5uNwR0YGewatFeq8nOEqcIlsV4PrTWRIANh93MCKyzYg) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products
----------------------------------------------

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT3LuxvvrEvRO0mVxnIj30zO9NB9aGSIo0QmzAAZ-nsU1rzHbltIeiI3930Rk5YL2gObZjbEPg2BQ3bKtvJKKarq7udO9gT8um6pP7VJga4mkBu314B89Mo4o1HrM3wUVgJBMFiQBZnpkG23KctVB8JQj6w), or [other terms and policies](#section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F&h=AT2ctYuZfZd2D7cH2OIELKnQI5PqCgm7f_9AFWmY2qYrQARcHtQf_eOUNvuoQlWvSWZs4Kw4QFaCfPAJ3Xhv0Qn3PrRd-YW2iTGWqrPGabjDNCoFlQk_bEuim569AQBjg--6xBXcM2QyryMGLZWr6AP_ymc), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F&h=AT2MqFhrN0S0hUyPo0AP6QssSHtsr7Yd0jH9Swqyu3yPppSkRkPDO5Ll8DVsTFPf5WIahjLY0ftrpgGSwmEJPCf_mszP97ZMXKcF7xbyE3S4T_RrdFRvsmj51b_IvodjVIUKl_DMv_rySpzq97RY68Fdiv4).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us
-------------------------------

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

**1\. Your content:** Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

**2\. Permission to use content that you create and share:** Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

**3\. Deleting your content:** You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

**4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content:** You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

**5\. Permission to update software that you use or download:** If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property
---------------------------------------------

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours).

4\. Additional provisions
-------------------------

4.1 Updating our Terms
----------------------

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination
-------------------------------------

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability
-----------------------

We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; the actions or conduct of others (whether online or offline); and events beyond our reasonable control.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.

4.4 Disputes
------------

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous
-----------------

1.  **Supplemental Terms:** Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  **Severability:** If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  **No transfer:** You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  **Legacy contact:** You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  **No third-party beneficiaries:** These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  **User name change:** We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  **Feedback:** We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

**Meta Commercial Terms ("Commercial Terms")**

These Commercial Terms apply to access or use of the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=commercial_terms) (or "**Products**"), for a business or commercial purpose (except where we state that separate terms, and not these Commercial Terms, apply to such access or use of a Facebook Product). Business or commercial purposes include using ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a Page, managing a Group for business purposes or using our measurement services regardless of the entity type.

You agree that you will ensure that any third party on whose behalf you access or use any Meta Product for any business or commercial purpose will abide by the applicable terms of use, including these Commercial Terms, the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/) ("**Terms**") and any applicable supplemental terms, and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that third party to such terms.

As more fully described below, if you reside in the United States or your business is located in the United States, these Commercial Terms require the resolution of most disputes between you and us by binding arbitration on an individual basis; class actions and jury trials are not permitted.

*   **Licences:** As described in _"The permissions you give us"_ section in our Terms, you grant us a licence to content that is covered by intellectual property rights (e.g. photos or videos) that you share, post or upload on or in connection with our Meta Products. For any access or use of the Meta Products, that licence applies to content that you or someone on your behalf (such as your agency that places an ad for you or your service provider that manages your Page content for you) makes available on or in connection with any Meta Product. You will also ensure that you own or have secured all rights necessary to grant the licences and rights that you (or someone on your behalf) grant to us under the Commercial Terms and any applicable supplemental terms, including permission to display, distribute and deliver your content within the Meta Products.
  
*   **Compliance with law:** You represent and warrant that your access or use of the Meta Products for business or commercial purposes complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You further represent that you will restrict access to your content and apps in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including geo-filtering or age-gating access where required. In addition to and without limiting the requirements about who can use the Meta Products under our Terms, if you are located in a country that is subject to embargo under the laws of the United States (or under similar laws applicable to you) you may not engage in commercial activities on the Meta Products unless authorised by applicable laws. If you are on the US Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals (or an equivalent list), you may not engage in commercial or business activities on the Meta Products (such as advertising or payments). You are also unable to access or use the Meta Products if you are prohibited from receiving products, services or software under applicable law.
  
*   **Data restrictions:** You may not send us information prohibited by the supplemental terms or policies. In addition, you may not send to us, or use Meta Products to collect from people, information that: (i) you know or reasonably should know is from or about children under the age of 13; or (ii) includes health, financial, biometrics or other categories of similarly sensitive information (including any information defined as sensitive under applicable law); except in cases where (a) the terms for that Meta Product specifically allow it or (b) you are sending financial information for the express purpose of effecting a financial transaction either with us or as enabled by a Meta Product.
  
*   **Limits on liability:** In addition to and without limiting the scope of the _"Limits on liability"_ section in our Terms, you agree that we are not responsible for the actions, services, content or data of third parties and you release us, our directors, officers, employees and agents from any claims and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim that you have against any such third parties.
    
    If you are a California resident, you agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says:
    
    A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOUR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.
    
    Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to any access or use of the Meta Products, the Terms (for any access or use of the Meta Products for business or commercial purposes) or these Commercial Terms will not exceed the greater of one hundred dollars (USD 100) or the amount that you have paid us in the past twelve months.
    
  
*   **Disputes:**
    
      
    *   Third-party claims: If anyone brings a claim, cause of action or dispute against us related to your services, actions, content or information on Facebook or other Meta Products or your use of any Meta Products, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any damages, losses and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to any such claim, cause of action or dispute.
    *   Commercial Claims: Sections 5.c and 5.d below apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that arises out of or relates to any access or use of the Meta Products for business or commercial purposes ("**Commercial Claim**") between you and Meta.
    *   US Commercial Claims: If you reside in the United States or your business is located in the United States:
        
        *   You agree to arbitrate Commercial Claims between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. This provision does not cover any commercial claims relating to breaches of your or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, breaches of the [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.meta.com%2Fbrand%2Fresources%2Fmeta%2Fcompany-brand%2F&h=AT1LHa7crUkXPpOXrtetqZYvM7J4nFLoLgXzcBjynDroqAUXct0Zpk1D2czjvmA-orcGrcuGmDav4Vpf8D3Ms_ZDK684tsVyh3PnOQl9dT3BOi9exdf6NylB5rboRejKFfSdjmp94B4c4hAyjgXmK7Joe3o), breaches of your or our confidential information or trade secrets, or efforts to interfere with our Products or engage with our Products in unauthorised ways (for example, automated ways). If a Commercial Claim between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. is not subject to arbitration, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.
        *   By entering into this arbitration provision, we and you agree that all parties are waiving their respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. You may bring a Commercial Claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Commercial Claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated according to the limitations of this Section 5.c, then only that Commercial Claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other Commercial Claims (or requests for relief) will remain subject to this Section 5.c. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. All issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions. If any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing. This notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address: Meta Platforms, Inc. 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025, US. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules ("**AAA Rules**"), as modified by these Commercial Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration provider or the court will appoint a substitute. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure. The arbitrator's award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party's trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative and arbitrator fees if your Commercial Claim for damages does not exceed USD 75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these Commercial Terms containing an arbitration provision. Your notice to us under this Section 5.c must be submitted to the address here: Meta Platforms, Inc. 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025, US. All Commercial Claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by California law, excluding California's conflict of laws rules, except to the extent that California law is contrary to or pre-empted by federal law. If a Commercial Claim between you and us is not subject to arbitration, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.
        
          
        
    *   Commercial Claims outside the United States: If you reside outside the United States or your business is located outside the United States, you agree that:
        
        *   Any Commercial Claim between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Commercial Terms and any such claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
        *   Any Commercial Claim between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited must be resolved exclusively in the courts of the Republic of Ireland, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and the laws of the Republic of Ireland will govern these Commercial Terms and any such claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
        *   Notwithstanding (i) and (ii) above, any Commercial Claim between you and both Meta Platforms, Inc. and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Commercial Terms and any such claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
        *   Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in our sole discretion, we may also bring any claim we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our Products in unauthorised ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
        
          
        
    *   European disputes: Nothing in this Section 5 shall limit or restrict any rights and remedies you have under the DMA. Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies you may have under these Commercial Terms and applicable laws, if you are a "business user" of our online social networking core platform service(s), please see the [alternative dispute settlement mechanism](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/905739804586436) ("ADSM") offered subject to Article 6(12) of the DMA. "Business user" is defined under Article 2 paragraph (21) of the Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 (the "Digital Markets Act" or "DMA").
    *   Severability: If any provision of this Section 5 is found unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the balance of this Section 5 will remain in full force and effect.
    
  
*   **Updates:** We may need to update these Commercial Terms from time to time, including to accurately reflect the access or uses of our Products for business or commercial purposes, and so we encourage you to check them regularly for any updates.

## Terms of Service from: https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines

**Music Guidelines**

These supplemental terms apply if you post, share or promote any videos or other content containing music on any [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139).

**You are responsible for the content you post or promote**

People use our Products to share content with their fans, family and friends. Bear in mind that you remain solely responsible for the content that you post or promote, including any music that is featured in that content. Nothing in these terms constitutes any authorisation by us with respect to any use of music on any of our Products.

Use of music for commercial or non-personal purposes in particular is prohibited unless you have obtained appropriate licences. Eligibility for, and participation in, Music Revenue Sharing does not by itself make a video commercial.

**You may not use content on our Products to create a music listening experience**

We want your fans, family and friends to be able to enjoy your content. However, if you use videos or other content on our Products to create a music listening experience for yourself or for others, your content may be blocked and your page, profile or group may be deleted. This includes live videos.

**Unauthorised content may be removed**

If you post content that contains music owned by someone else, your content may be reviewed by the applicable rights owner and your content may be blocked, muted or removed if your use of that music is not properly authorised.

**You may not be able to post or access content containing music in every country of the world**

We want you to be able to share content with your fans, family and friends wherever they are, but any music in your content, if it is allowed at all, may not be available in all countries of the world.

**The following guidelines can help you plan for your content:**

*   The greater the density of music in content, the more likely it may be limited (e.g. blocked, muted or ineligible for [Music Revenue Share](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/516305840204016))
*   Shorter clips of music are recommended
*   There should always be a visual component to your content; recorded audio should not be the primary purpose of the content
*   For additional information, please see [Updates and Guidelines for Including Music in Video](https://www.facebook.com/formedia/blog/updates-and-guidelines-for-including-music-in-video)

**You may be able to dispute the action taken on your content**

If you believe you have the rights to use the music content that was restricted, or that an action was taken in error, you may be able to dispute that action via the notification you received. Depending on the nature of restriction, our tools may enable you to contact the applicable rights holder directly; the content may be automatically restored; or your dispute may be reviewed by a member of Meta's operations teams to confirm these policies were appropriately applied.

You may also be able to access and use third-party software and services (collectively, "**Third-party Services**") in connection with your use of the Avatars Services. Your use of any Third-party Services is at your own risk, and you acknowledge that such use may be subject to additional terms, conditions, fees and policies imposed by the provider of the applicable Third-party Service (collectively, "**Third-party Terms**").

IF YOU ARE NOT OF LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION, YOU MAY ONLY USE THE AVATARS SERVICES WITH THE PERMISSION AND UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN WHO AGREES BOTH TO BE BOUND BY THESE AVATARS TERMS AND TO BIND YOU TO THESE AVATARS TERMS.

ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT, AS SET OUT IN THE "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION BELOW, ANY DISPUTES THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US OR OUR AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE AVATARS TERMS, THE AVATARS SERVICES OR YOUR USE THEREOF WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS (INCLUDING WHERE CONSUMER LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS) AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.

*   **Updates**. We may update these Avatars Terms from time to time by notifying you of the updated Avatars Terms, at least 30 days before we make changes, by any reasonable means. Any changes to these Avatars Terms will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we notified you of the updated Avatars Terms. Your use of the Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar, following any changes to these Avatars Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The "Last updated" legend above indicates when these Avatars Terms were last changed.
    
*   **Accounts**. You must have an active, personal Facebook, Instagram, Meta or other Meta-supported account in order to access and use the Avatars Services. The account that is first used to generate or assemble Generated Content or to Acquire (as defined below) a Licensed Avatar Item is referred to as the "**Controlling Account**" for such Generated Content or Licensed Avatar Item, as applicable. In order to access or use such Generated Content or Licensed Avatar Item on any additional account, you must connect the additional account to the Controlling Account via the [Account Centre](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fhelp%2Faccounts-center%2FInformation-used-across-accounts%2F&h=AT3vrivarMBtiYCqwEqjR_aYFUPqPobHGccsv4qppH7ZqkgHx9iszodStiwicgF7QfxyjlKalzv41MJo-y8577t81wFlfrccq05BkwxZmoEy8_Ikkk4H4i5-ZbGVghCY2KmafTG55GsyNHI0PXdpTcPf3uk) (each additional account once connected, a "**Connected Account**"). If you delete a Controlling Account or such Controlling Account is otherwise suspended or disabled, your Avatar and other Generated Content associated with such Controlling Account may still be accessible via the Connected Account(s); however, any Licensed Avatar Items associated with such Controlling Account will be deleted and will no longer be accessible via any Connected Account(s). You will not receive a refund for any Licensed Avatar Items that are no longer accessible due to the suspension, disabling or deletion of the Controlling Account associated with such Licensed Avatar Items in accordance with this Section 2.
    
    Business accounts may be permitted by Meta to Acquire, at no charge, certain Licensed Avatar Items designated by Meta for such accounts and made available by Meta in the Avatars Services. Licensed Avatar Items purchased in connection with a personal Controlling Account may not be accessed or used in connection with any business account. You acknowledge that if you convert your personal account to a business account, any Licensed Avatar Items associated with your personal account may no longer be accessible and you will not be entitled to a refund in connection with such Licensed Avatar Items. If you delete a business account or such account is otherwise suspended or disabled, any Licensed Avatar Items associated with such business account will be deleted and will no longer be accessible. You will not receive a refund for any Licensed Avatar Items that are no longer accessible due to the suspension, disabling or deletion of the business account associated Licensed Avatar Items.
    
*   **Generated Content**.
    
    *   Avatar Tools.
        
    
    *   As part of the Avatars Services, Meta may offer you access to Avatar Tools that can be used to assemble or generate a Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Items. For example, Avatar Tools may include (A) tools that allow you to assemble an Avatar by selecting from a collection of pre-determined attributes made available by Meta; (B) tools that enable us to create an Avatar for you based on a selfie video recording or photo of yourself submitted by you (e.g. [AutoGen](https://www.facebook.com/help/276796764805785?helpref=faq_content)), or based on one or more of your public profile photos on Meta Company Products (e.g. [Instant Avatar](https://www.facebook.com/help/622616883312812)s); and (C) tools that enable us to create Generated Avatar Items based on text prompts or descriptions submitted by you. Certain Avatars Services, including certain Avatar Tools, may not be available in all locations.
        
    *   If, in connection with your use of the Avatar Tools, you provide us with access to, or otherwise make available to us, any images, videos or other content, including any selfie video recordings or photos or any profile photos ("**User Content**"), you hereby grant to Meta a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide licence to reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works based upon, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), and otherwise use such User Content and your image, likeness and other personal characteristics as captured or reflected therein (your "**Persona**") in connection with Generated Content and the Avatars Services, including the marketing and promotion thereof (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your User Content is deleted from our systems. Please review the [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) for instructions on how to manage and delete your information.
        
        You hereby acknowledge and agree that, even if a Meta Avatar is generated from your User Content, such Meta Avatar may nevertheless have similarities to other Meta Avatars, and that Meta has no responsibility or liability for any similarities between or among Meta Avatars, and that you will not object to, and will have no right to prevent, other Avatars Services users from having such Meta Avatars. Further, you hereby acknowledge that any Meta Avatar generated from your User Content will not, and is not intended to, reflect your Persona.
        
    *   You hereby acknowledge and agree that (A) there are a finite number of assets and features used to create Meta Avatars and Generated Avatar Items and, as a result, other users of the Avatars Services may create or generate a Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Item with an identical or similar combination of assets and features as those used by you for your Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Items, and (B) you will not object to, and have no right to prevent, other Avatars Services users from having such Meta Avatars or Generated Avatar Items.
        
    
    *   Licence to Generated Content. Subject to these Avatars Terms, and solely for so long as you are permitted by Meta to use the Avatars Services, by assembling or generating a Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Items using an Avatar Tool, Meta grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use such Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Items solely for your personal, non-commercial use (except as expressly set forth in the "Limited Commercial Use" section below). If you materially or repeatedly fail to comply with these Avatars Terms, the rights granted to you herein shall immediately terminate and you shall cease all use of the Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar and Generated Avatar Items.
        
    *   Additional caveats. Meta does not guarantee that any Avatar Tool or Generated Content will be made available or, if made available, will remain available. Meta may, at any time, remove any Avatar Tool or Generated Content from any Meta Company Product or change, supplement, impose additional restrictions or limits on, suspend, delete or discontinue any Avatar Tool or Generated Content for any reason, except where reasonable advance notice is required by law, in which case we will provide such notice. If we remove any Generated Content for violation of the Community Standards, we will let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability, harm to other users, or compromise the integrity or operation of our services.
        
    
*   **Meta****Avatars Store; Licensed Avatar Items**.
    

*   Meta Avatars Store. As part of the Avatars Services, and subject to compliance with these Avatars Terms, Meta makes available a digital store where users can access, view, interact with, and purchase or otherwise acquire a licence to use Licensed Avatar Items (the "**Avatars Store**") for their Meta Avatar (any such purchase or acquisition, an "**Acquisition**"). For clarity, some Licensed Avatar Items may be made available in the Avatars Store for Acquisition at no charge.
    
*   Licensed Avatar Items Listings. The Avatars Store may make available listings, descriptions and images of Licensed Avatar Items, or related discounts. The availability through the Avatars Store of any listing, description or image of a Licensed Avatar Item does not imply our endorsement of, or affiliation with, any third-party licensor(s) associated with such Licensed Avatar Item. We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity or timeliness of such listings, descriptions or images (including any features, specifications and prices contained therein). Such information and the availability of any Licensed Avatar Item (including the validity of any discount) are subject to change at any time without notice, except where reasonable advance notice is required by law in which case we will provide such notice. Descriptions of Licensed Avatar Items are approximate and are for convenience only. The colours of Avatar items may vary depending on the device on which you are viewing such items, and we cannot guarantee that a device will accurately display such colours. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and foreign laws (including minimum age requirements) regarding the purchase, possession and use of any Licensed Avatar Item.
    
*   Licensed Avatar Items. All Licensed Avatar Items are licensed, not sold, to you under these Avatars Terms, and references to "sale" or "purchase" relate solely to acquiring a licence to access and use a Licensed Avatar Item. Subject to these Avatars Terms and the Additional Terms, and solely for so long as you are permitted by Meta to use the Avatars Services, by completing an Acquisition of a Licensed Avatar Item, you receive from Meta a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use such Licensed Avatar Item that is the subject of such purchase, solely for your personal, non-commercial use (except as expressly set forth in the "Limited Commercial Use" section below).
    
    Meta does not guarantee that any Licensed Avatar Items will be made available or, if made available, will remain available. Meta may, at any time, remove any Licensed Avatar Item from any Meta Company Product or change, supplement, impose additional restrictions or limits on, suspend, delete or discontinue any Licensed Avatar Item or these Avatars Terms for any reason, except where reasonable advance notice is required by law in which case we will provide such notice. You further acknowledge that Licensed Avatar Items Acquired by you may not be unique, and that we may make available identical or similar Licensed Avatar Items to other users of the Avatars Services.
    
    Certain Licensed Avatar Items may only be accessed and used for a limited period of time or a limited number of times. If you Acquire such a Licensed Avatar Item, it will be removed from your inventory or otherwise become unavailable to you after such period has elapsed or the total number of uses has been reached, as applicable.
    
*   Third-party Content. Licensed Avatar Items may incorporate content owned by a third party, including third-party logos, brands, or designs ("**Third-party Content**"). You acknowledge and agree that you have no right to use such Third-party Content in any way except as incorporated into a Licensed Avatar Item and in accordance with these Avatars Terms, the Additional Terms and any applicable Third-party Terms.
    
*   Purchases. Your use of payment features in connection with an Acquisition is subject to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms) and, depending on how you access the Avatars Store, your Acquisition(s) may also be subject to Third-party Terms (for example, certain Third-party Terms of Apple or Google may apply to Acquisitions conducted, respectively, via the iOS platform or the Android platform).
    
    By tapping the "Buy Now", "Add" or a similar button located in various sections of the Avatars Store concerning the Licensed Avatar Item of your choice, you agree to the Acquisition of such Licensed Avatar Item. When making an Acquisition, you may be required to provide some or all of the following information: your name, postal address, billing information and other information as required by law. You represent and warrant that all information is accurate and complete. You are responsible for ensuring that your account information (including any contact information) is kept current. We will have no responsibility or liability for inaccurate or incomplete information or for information that later becomes outdated. Additionally, we have no obligation to make efforts to determine your correct information. You acknowledge that there may be a delay between completion of an Acquisition and the availability of the Licensed Avatar Item(s) that is the subject of the Acquisition.
    
    In connection with your Acquisitions, Meta or a third-party payment processor will collect, process and store your payment and related information, which may include certain personal information.
    
    We reserve the right, including without prior notice, to: (i) limit the available quantity of, or discontinue making available, any Licensed Avatar Item; (ii) impose conditions on the honouring of any discount or similar promotion; (iii) bar any user from making any Acquisition; and/or (iv) refuse to provide, or continue to provide, any user with any Licensed Avatar Item. We will, however, provide reasonable advance notice where such notice is required by law.
    
    You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or on your behalf through the Avatars Services, at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. If your purchase is subject to any type of use or sales tax, duty or other governmental tax or fee ("**taxes**"), then you may be charged for those taxes. You are responsible for any Taxes due with respect to your purchase of Licensed Avatar Items.
    
*   Refunds. All Acquisitions on the Avatars Store are final except as required by applicable law. Except where a full or pro-rated refund is required by applicable law, acquisitions of Licensed Avatar Items are not redeemable or subject to refund by Meta and cannot be traded for money or other items of value. To the extent that you engage in an Acquisition via a Third-party Service, the provider of such Third-party Service may allow for refunds under certain circumstances pursuant to its applicable Third-party Terms; if so, you will need to deal directly with such provider (and not with us) if you seek a refund in connection with such Acquisition.
    

*   **Ownership**. You acknowledge and agree that, as between you and Meta, Meta and/or its third-party licensors own, and will retain all right, title and interest in and to, the Avatars Services, including any and all Meta Avatars, Avatar Items and Avatar Tools. To the extent you have or obtain any right, title or interest in or to the Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar, Avatar Items or Avatar Tools, you hereby assign to Meta all such right, title and interest, including any intellectual property rights therein. If, for any reason, the above assignment of rights is ineffective, you hereby grant to Meta a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free, fully paid up, irrevocable, worldwide licence to reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works based upon, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), and otherwise use any rights you may have in or to the Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar, Avatar Items and Avatar Tools, including in the marketing and promotion thereof.
    
*   **Restrictions**. In connection with the Avatars Services, you must not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the object code, source code or underlying algorithms relating to the Avatars Services or any portion thereof (including any Meta Avatar or Avatar Item), except where such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law; (b) modify, translate or create derivative works based upon the Avatars Services or any portion thereof, including any Meta Avatar; or (c) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice from the Avatars Services or any portion thereof.

        If we determine or suspect that you have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this subsection (a), we may suspend or terminate (at our discretion) your right to use the Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar, Avatar Items and/or Avatar Tools. Following any such suspension or termination, any subsequent ability to use the Avatars Services will be at Meta's sole discretion.
        
    *   Limited Commercial Use. As a limited exception to the foregoing, you may use your Meta Avatar and any Avatar Items for commercial, business and other non-personal purposes only in connection with (i) certain Meta Company Products, and only as so designated by Meta in connection with such Meta Company Products; and (ii) certain Third-party Services that permit such use (but subject to any limitations imposed by the applicable providers of such Third-party Services and by Meta in connection with the applicable Meta Company Products through which such Third-party Services are made available) ("**commercial use**"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any commercial use shall (A) comply with these Avatars Terms, the Additional Terms and any applicable Third-party Terms; (B) comply with all applicable laws, including applicable government regulations or guidelines concerning endorsements, advertising and promotions, including the US Federal Trade Commission's Endorsement Guides; (C) be neither derogatory to Meta nor damage the value, reputation or goodwill of Meta or any of its products or brands (as determined by Meta); (D) neither suggest nor imply any form of association, approval or endorsement by Meta or any third party where none exists; and (E) not include any falsehoods or misrepresentations about Meta or any third parties.
        
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you represent and warrant that, in connection with any commercial use, you have reviewed and will comply with the US Federal Trade Commission's Endorsement Guides, including any disclosure obligations; and any endorsement, advertising or promotion in connection with the commercial use will reflect your honest opinions, beliefs and/or experiences, and will not be false, deceptive or misleading.
        
        To the extent that the commercial use relates to branded content (as defined in the [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/221149188908254/)), such content is governed by the [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/221149188908254/) as if it were posted using the branded content tool.
        
        If we determine or suspect that you have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this subsection (b), or if we receive objections from others regarding any commercial use by you, we may, with immediate effect and without notice to you, revoke your permission for you to make commercial use of your Avatar and/or Avatar Items, or may suspend or terminate (at our discretion) your right to use the Avatars Services and/or any Meta Avatar or Avatar Items. Following any such suspension or termination, any subsequent ability to use the Avatars Services (or any portion thereof) will be at Meta's sole discretion.
        
    
*   **Termination**. These Avatars Terms are effective until terminated by us or by you. If you materially or repeatedly fail to comply with these Avatars Terms, you shall immediately cease using the Avatars Services, including any Generated Content or Licensed Avatar Items, and any licence to any Generated Content or Licensed Avatar Items granted to you will terminate automatically. In addition to any termination or suspension rights set forth in the Additional Terms, we may terminate or suspend your access to the Avatars Services or to any specific Generated Content or Licensed Avatar Items on any or all relevant Meta Company Products at any time by providing reasonable advance notice if required by law, including if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Avatars Terms. Upon any such termination or suspension, your right to use the Avatars Services will immediately cease. Sections 3 (except 3.b), 4 (except 4.b), 5, 6, 7 and 9-15 of these Avatars Terms will survive any termination of the Avatars Services and/or these Avatars Terms.
    
*   **Feedback**.If you submit to us any comments, questions, suggestions, use cases (whether actual or proposed), problems, issues, ideas, results or other feedback relating to your use of the Avatars Services ("**Feedback**"), we and our designees may freely use and otherwise exploit such Feedback in connection with any of our products or services or those of any of our affiliates or business partners, without obligation or compensation to you. You hereby assign to Meta all rights, titles and interest in and to any Feedback, without any right to compensation from Meta, and nothing in these Avatars Terms or in the parties' dealings arising out of or related to these Avatars Terms or the Avatars Services will restrict Meta's right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, keep secret or otherwise exploit any Feedback, without compensating or crediting you, the individual employee, or other authorised personnel providing such Feedback.
    
*   **Disclaimers**.The Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar, Avatar Items, Generated Content and Avatar Tools, are provided "AS IS" and we make no representations or guarantees that they will always be safe, secure or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the fullest extent permitted by law, WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR: (A) THE DELETION OF, OR THE FAILURE TO STORE OR TRANSMIT, THE AVATARS SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY META AVATAR OR AVATAR ITEMS (INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY CONTENT); (B) ANY USER CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR OTHER CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES OR STORES ON OR THROUGH THE AVATARS SERVICES; (C) THE COMPLETENESS, QUALITY, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, SECURITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE AVATARS SERVICES; (D) ANY HARM TO YOUR DEVICE, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER HARM THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE AVATARS SERVICES; (E) THE OPERATION OR COMPATIBILITY OF THE AVATARS SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY META AVATAR OR AVATAR ITEMS (INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY CONTENT), WITH ANY OTHER APPLICATION OR ANY PARTICULAR SYSTEM OR DEVICE; (F) ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES; AND (G) WHETHER OR NOT THE AVATARS SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE BASIS.
    
    META ASSUMES NO OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, AND WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR ENDORSEMENTS REGARDING ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.
    
    We do not control or direct what Avatars Services users and other third parties do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content). Your rights are not modified by the foregoing disclaimer if the laws of your country or territory of residence, applicable as a result of your use of the Avatar Services, do not permit it.
    
*   **Indemnification**.To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) any actual or alleged breach of these Avatars Terms, the Additional Terms or any Third-party Terms by you or by any third party to whom you have made available access to or use of the Avatars Services; (b) any use of the Avatars Services in violation of applicable law by you or associated with your account; (c) your use of, or activities in connection with, the Avatars Services, including, without limitation, any commercial use; (d) your violation of any rights of any third party; (e) any dispute between you and any other user of the Avatars Services related to the Avatars Services (including any Meta Avatar, Avatar Item or User Content); (f) your User Content; and (g) your negligence or wilful misconduct. In the event that Meta requests that you provide Meta's defence to such a claim, you agree that, in providing such defence, Meta: (x) shall be consulted regarding, and shall have the right to approve (at our sole discretion), defence strategy, any appeal and any settlement of the claim; (y) shall have the right to select defence counsel; and (z) may further participate in the defence of the claim with counsel of our own choice at our own expense.
    
*   **Limitation of liability**.We cannot predict when issues might arise with the Avatars Services. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and, subject to this limitation, under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Avatars Terms or the Avatars Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    
    Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Avatars Terms, the Avatars Services (including any Meta Avatar or Avatar Items), or any Third-party Services will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amount you have actually paid to us in connection with the Avatars Services in the twelve (12) months preceding the date on which the claim arose; and (b) one-hundred US dollars (USD 100). THE LAWS OF SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
*   **Dispute resolution**.
    
    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES WITH US (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE AVATARS TERMS OR THE AVATARS SERVICES, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
    
    Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Avatars Terms or the Avatars Services (including any Meta Avatar or Avatar Items) ("**claim(s)**") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your or our own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other users or purchasers of the Avatars Services. If there is a final judicial determination that any claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with the limitations of this "dispute resolution" section, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this "Dispute Resolution" section.
    
    Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**") will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by these Avatars Terms. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
    
    The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination shall be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Avatars Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you. In addition, disputes relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.
    
    This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You can opt out of this arbitration provision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first agreed to any version of these Avatars Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, email address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration provision here: Meta Platforms, Inc. FAO: Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, US.
    
    Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address, a detailed description of the dispute and the relief that you seek. Any Notice of Dispute that you send to us should be posted to Meta Platforms, Inc., FAO: Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, US. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address that you provided or by other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.
    
    We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration that we bring or if your claims seek less than USD 75,000 and you timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the AAA's applicable rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.
    
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Avatars Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Avatars Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta Platforms Inc. may also bring any claim that we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our products in unauthorised ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
    
*   **Miscellaneous**.
    
    *   Assignment. You may not assign these Avatars Terms or any of the rights granted hereunder without the prior written consent of Meta, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, these Avatars Terms will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. All of our rights and obligations under these Avatars Terms are freely assignable by us, including, without limitation, in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law.
        
    *   Trade compliance. You will comply with all applicable US and non-US export controls, import controls and trade sanctions laws ("**Trade Laws**") when accessing Avatar Tools and Avatar Items and when using Avatars Services. You will not access, use or download, or allow others to access, use or download, Avatar Tools, Avatar Items or Avatars Services, or conduct purchase transactions: (i) if you or they are located in a country or region subject to comprehensive US trade sanctions; (ii) if you or they are listed on any US or EU restricted parties list; (iii) in connection with activities, individuals or entities that are located in a country or region subject to comprehensive US trade sanctions; or (iv) in any way that would otherwise violate applicable Trade Laws, including end use and end user restrictions. You or they will not disguise your or their location through IP proxying or other methods.
        
        You will not, and will not allow others to, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, provide, resell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Avatar Tools, Avatar Items or Avatars Services: (A) to any individual, entity, country or region prohibited by Trade Laws; (B) to anyone on any US or EU government restricted parties list; or (C) for any purpose prohibited by Trade Laws.
        
        You will not, and will not allow others to, use, distribute or transfer the Avatar Tools, Avatar Items or Avatars Services, or Third-party Services in any manner that violates applicable laws, including all applicable Trade Laws.
        
        The Avatar Tools, Avatar Items and Avatars Services may not be resold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a country or region subject to comprehensive US trade sanctions or to a person or organisation on any US or EU restricted parties list.
        
    *   Severability. If any provision of these Avatars Terms is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Avatars Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
        
    *   No third-party beneficiaries. These Avatars Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
        
    *   Entire agreement. These Avatars Terms and the Additional Terms (and any agreements incorporated by reference therein) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta related to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and Meta relating to such subject matter.

Meta AIs Terms of Service

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply when you access and use Meta AIs and other software, tools, services, documentation, content, functionalities, and generative AI features that we make available to you through any Meta product (collectively, “AIs”). These terms are a legally binding agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). By using AIs, you agree to be bound by these Terms, the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php), and any other applicable terms and policies.

  
**1\. Your Commitments**

A. Eligibility

Without limiting the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) or any other applicable terms or policies, you cannot access AIs if you are under the age of 13 (or such greater age required in your country or territory) or if you are prohibited from receiving our services or software under applicable laws.

B. Acceptable Uses

You may not access, use, or allow others to access or use AIs in any matter that would:

*   Violate any applicable law (including but not limited to any manner that promotes, contributes to, or encourages illegal or unlawful activity), including conduct that describes, encourages, supports, or distributes in any form child sexual abuse materials
*   Generate, promote, disseminate, or otherwise use or facilitate content that may harm other individuals, including to encourage self-harm, discrimination, bullying, humiliation, and/or other emotional harms. This also includes causing harm by using AIs to: (i) deploy subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques to distort behavior by impairing decision making; or (ii) exploit people due to their age, disability, or a specific social or economic situation to distort their behavior

*   Override safety or privacy filters, controls, or mechanisms

  
**2\. Prompts, Results, and Other Content**

A. Rights to Content

AIs allows you to provide materials for processing, which could include text, documents, images, or recordings, depending on the integration (together, “Prompts”) and will generate a response (“Outputs”) based on your Prompts, as well as any feedback you provide (“Feedback”) collectively, “Content”. You may not provide prompts or use AIs in any way that infringes or violates someone else’s rights, including intellectual property rights. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you retain all right, title, and interest – including any intellectual property rights – that you have in and to your Prompts. You agree that your provision of Prompts will not violate these Terms, including the Acceptable Uses, and other policies that apply to your use of AIs, which we may supplement, update, or revise, at any time.

B. Personal Information

The [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) governs our processing of personal information collected through the AIs and explains how we collect, use, and share personal information - including personal information you submit as Prompts, Feedback, or other Content, your activity across our products, and personal information we collect from and about your device. We may process personal information, including any sensitive information, as described in the Privacy Policy, to improve AIs and related technology.

When information is shared with AIs, the AIs may retain and use that information to provide more personalized Outputs. Do not share information that you don’t want the AIs to use and retain such as account identifiers, passwords, financial information, or other sensitive information.

Meta may share certain information about you that is processed when using the AIs with third parties who help us provide you with more relevant or useful responses. For example, we may share questions contained in a Prompt with a third-party search engine, and include the search results in the response to your Prompt. The information we share with third parties may contain personal information if your Prompt contains personal information about any person. By using AIs, you are instructing us to share your information with third parties when it may provide you with more relevant or useful responses. Those third parties will use any information we share – which may include personal information about you or others – in accordance with those third parties’ privacy policies. You can view the list of these third parties, and links to their privacy policies, by visiting our [Privacy Center](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners). We may add or remove third parties from time to time, and notice will be provided solely by adding or removing that party from the list referenced above.

Meta may review your interactions with AIs, including the content of your conversations with or messages to AIs, and this review may be automated or manual (human).

Depending on where you reside, you or an authorized agent may request access to your personal information from Meta in a portable format, deletion of your personal information, or correction of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions. To learn more about how you can access and delete your personal information associated with AIs, and exercise any applicable rights, visit our [Privacy Center](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/genai?entry_point=whatsapp_genai). It is important that you review the Privacy Center before you try to delete any personal information or delete or deactivate your account. Depending on how you use AIs, deleting individual messages, entire threads, or even your account may not delete our copy of your personal information, and the Privacy Center describes the correct way to delete your personal information.

C. Accuracy

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,** META MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OF ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING OUTPUTS, OR ANY OUTPUTS THAT ARE DISTURBING OR UPSETTING. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON OUTPUTS FOR ANY PURPOSE OR USE OUTPUTS TO INFORM PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OR DECISIONS RELATED TO MEDICINE, FINANCE, LAW, OR PHARMACEUTICALS. IF YOU PLAN TO USE OUTPUTS FOR ANY REASON, IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO VERIFY OUTPUTS. AIS AND ANY CONTENT MAY NOT REFLECT ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR CURRENT INFORMATION.

D. Warning Regarding Content

The AIs will generate Content based on Prompts that you provide. The specific Content that the AIs will return based on your Prompts cannot be predicted in advance. AIs MIGHT GENERATE CONTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER OFFENSIVE OR OBJECTIONABLE AND/OR THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT META’S VIEWS. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND BY USING AIS, YOU RECOGNIZE AND ASSUME THE RISK THAT THE PROMPTS YOU PROVIDE MIGHT RESULT IN GENERATION OF CONTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER OFFENSIVE OR OBJECTIONABLE. YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT YOU – NOT META – ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF, AND/OR ANY ACTIONS YOU TAKE IN RELATION TO, CONTENT GENERATED BY THE AIS BASED ON YOUR PROMPTS.

  
**3\. Meta's Rights**

A. Meta’s Rights Regarding Content

Meta may use Content and related information as described in the Meta Terms of Service and Meta Privacy Policy, and may do so through automated or manual (i.e. human) review and through third-party vendors in some instances, including:

*   To provide, maintain, and improve Meta services and features.
*   To conduct and support research
*   To monitor your use of AIs for compliance with these Terms and applicable laws and to report violations of applicable laws or regulations as required by law
*   To remove unsafe, discriminatory, or other Content that violates these Terms, Meta’s Community Standards, or any other applicable policies and terms
*   To suspend or remove accounts that violate these Terms with respect to your use of AIs

B. Suspension and Termination

If we determine that you have breached these Terms or other applicable terms and policies, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to AIs or other Meta services or features, and we may permanently disable or delete your account including where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

  
**4\. Image Processing**

Depending on where you are located, you may have the option to share images with AIs. Once shared, you agree that Meta will analyze those images, including facial features, using AI. This processing allows us to offer innovative new features, including the ability to summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image. You further agree that you will not upload images to Meta AI that you know to contain individuals that reside in Illinois or Texas, unless you are their legally authorized representative and consent on their behalf.

  
**5\. Ownership of AIs**

We retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to AIs. Other than the rights of access and use expressly granted in these Terms, these Terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to the AIs.

**6\. Third Party Materials**

AIs may use or be used in connection with content, services, features, and integrations provided by third parties. Meta is not responsible for your use of third party content, services, features, and integrations, and you use these at your own risk.

  
**7\. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability**

A. Disclaimer of Warranties

AIs and Outputs are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, and**,** to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we make no guarantees that they will be safe, secure, or error-free, or will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for Outputs, and you are responsible for checking Outputs for accuracy and suitability. The Outputs provided by AIs do not reflect the views of Meta, our affiliates, or our personnel.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, PRIVACY, COMPATIBILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY IMPLIED BY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR TRADE USAGE.

B. Limitations on Liability

Our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or AIs (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

The laws of some states or jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations set out above may not apply to you. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, in such cases, Meta’s liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  
**8\. Disputes**

Any claim, cause of action, or dispute that arises out of or relates to these Meta AIs Terms is subject to the disputes resolution clause in the Meta Terms of Service.

  
**9\. Severability**

If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.

  
**10\. Changes to These Terms**

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience, and/or to comply with applicable law. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example through email or in-app notification) of any material changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect you will be bound by them if you continue to use our **AIs**. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you should stop using AIs before they go into effect.

  
**11\. Effective Date**

Self-serve Ad Terms

The following terms ("**Self-serve Advertising Terms**" or "**Self-serve Ad Terms**") apply to your use of [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139) (such as the self-service advertising interfaces and APIs) for creation, submission and/or delivery of any advertising or other commercial or sponsored activity or content (collectively, "**Self-serve Ad Interfaces**") and any order that you place through the Self-serve Ad Interfaces ("**Order**").

If we accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as inventory becomes available. Subject to Section 5, when serving your ad, we use best efforts to deliver the ads to the audience you specify or to achieve the outcome that you select, although we cannot guarantee in every instance that your ad will reach its intended target or achieve the outcome that you select.
*   Your ads must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, as well as our [Advertising Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/). Failure to comply may result in a variety of consequences, including the cancellation of ads that you have placed and termination of your account.

You are responsible for bearing and remitting any taxes that apply to your transactions. You will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of your failure to do so.
    *   If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may take additional steps to collect past due amounts. You will pay all expenses associated with such collection, including reasonable legal fees. Past due amounts will accrue interest at 1% per month or the lawful maximum, whichever is less.
    *   We may allow you to purchase ads with an "Advertiser Balance", which is a pre-paid balance that can be used solely to purchase ads on Meta. Advertiser Balances are only for business or commercial purposes. Advertiser Balances are non-refundable except where required by law. Facebook is not a bank and does not offer banking services; accordingly, Advertiser Balances do not earn interest, are not deposit obligations and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any other entity or insurance scheme, whether governmental or private.
    *   You will fall under one of two categories depending on your payment method: invoiced or non-invoiced client. Invoiced clients are those for whom Meta sets a maximum spending limit and issues invoices on a periodic basis for payment in accordance with the applicable invoicing terms. Non-invoiced clients are those who must make payments at the time of purchase itself. In its sole discretion, Meta may classify clients as invoiced clients based on factors such as ad spend and creditworthiness.
    
*   You understand that, from time to time, we run tests on our Self-serve Ad Interfaces and related systems, which may affect your use and experience thereof, including campaign performance. You acknowledge and agree that we may test as notified in these Terms, including to assess formatting, relevance, pricing, reporting, targeting and delivery.
*   We will determine the size, placement and positioning of your ads.
*   Scheduling of delivery is subject to availability and may not be continuous.
*   We do not guarantee the reach or performance that your ads will receive, such as the number of people who will see your ads or the number of clicks your ads will get.
*   We cannot control how clicks are generated on your ads. We have systems that attempt to detect and filter certain click activity, but we are not responsible for click fraud, technological issues or other potentially invalid click activity that may affect the cost of running ads.
*   Our licence to deliver your ad will end when we have completed your Order. You understand, however, that:
    
    *   Once displayed, ads are public information. Ads may be re-shared and accessed outside of the targeted audience (including from the Facebook Page or profile or Instagram Professional Account running the ads or within Meta Products). If users have interacted with your ad, your ad may remain on our Products (_e.g. shared until the users delete it, or visible to users through their account tools)._
    *   If your ad is about [social issues, elections or politics](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/restricted_content/political), Meta may display (at no cost to you) and provide access to the ad content and creative, and information about the ad campaign (such as total spend and delivery data, and targeting information) for a period of seven years from the completion of your order.
    *   You consent that Meta may disclose your advertising content, and all information associated with your advertising, to a governmental entity or body if Meta believes that disclosure would assist in a lawful investigation.
    
*   We will provide you with reports about the kinds of people seeing your ads and how your ads are performing. Your use of these reports is subject to the Data Use Restrictions in our [Advertising Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/). We may provide a business, and all those who advertise for the business, with information about the number of ads being run for the business across the Meta Products and any applicable restrictions on those ads.
*   We offer tools to provide transparency to our users about how Meta advertising works and control over their ads experience, including information sufficient to show them why they are being shown specific ads. You agree that information associated with your advertising may be included in these tools, and that those tools may affect your ability to advertise to those users or to prevent them from seeing your ads.
*   You will not issue any press release or make public statements about your relationship with Meta or the Meta Products without our prior written permission.
*   If you are placing ads on someone else's behalf, you must have permission to place those ads, and agree as follows:
    
    *   You represent and warrant that you have the authority to and will bind the advertiser to these Self-serve Ad Terms and the Terms of Service, and the [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms), to which you also agree.
    *   If the advertiser you represent violates these Self-serve Ad Terms, the Terms of Service or the Commercial Terms, we may hold you responsible for that violation.
    *   You agree that we may provide campaign reporting information to the end advertiser for whom you placed a campaign.
    
*   We may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your use of a specific feature or functionality made available through the Self-serve Ad Interfaces. To the extent that those supplemental terms conflict with these Self-serve Ad Terms, the supplemental terms will govern with respect to your use of the specific feature or functionality to the extent of the conflict. We may change or update these Self-serve Ad Terms from time to time and your continued use of the Self-serve Ad Interfaces constitutes acceptance of those changes.
*   Contracting party:
    
    *   If you reside or have your principal place of business in the United States or Canada, Meta Platforms, Inc. provides the Self-serve Ad Interfaces.
    *   If you reside or have your principal place of business outside the United States or Canada, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited provides the Self-serve Ad Interfaces.
    *   Notwithstanding the above, advertisers in some countries may be subject to special provisions regarding Orders they place, including, under certain circumstances, that they contract directly with Meta affiliate companies solely for purposes of placing Orders. If applicable to you, you can find these special provisions applicable to your Orders [here.](https://www.facebook.com/legal/country_specific_ads_terms) In addition, if you operate an online classified ads service in the European Economic Area in line with the European Commission's Decision in [Case AT.40684](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fcommission%2Fpresscorner%2Fdetail%2Fen%2Fip_24_5801&h=AT23J279UcMxFCUbkA-4uGSmLP-7kJ5UNNGMFIgjZkKLWl6Ye5Q2pe-fZw0t_vZcbm_TYiWsLaskL8kLonkDjwexC9ZeCRzQfoXq9vUszDCw_1XaqIdySUdcYXu3URTxQNDAdtNIqNQJMH7sTYZJ5R-7osk), these **[OCAS Supplemental Ads Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ocas_supplemental_ads_terms)** will apply to you and are incorporated herein by reference.
    *   For the avoidance of doubt, regardless which entity you contract with (as described in Sections 16.a, 16.b and 16.c), Meta's [Advertising Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/) (and its Community Standards as incorporated) are enforced under the Terms of Service by the entity that provides the Meta Products under the applicable Terms of Service in your region.
    
*   Any claim, cause of action or dispute that arises out of or relates to these Self-serve Ad Terms is subject to the disputes resolution clause in the Commercial Terms.
*   These Self-serve Ad Terms will terminate in the event of any termination of the Commercial Terms, but the following provisions will still apply: the lead-in paragraph and Sections 2, 4, 8-12 and 15-18.

Those terms and policies are considered null and void and are rejected and excluded from these Terms.
            
        *   3\. Nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as a representation or agreement that we will not develop or have not developed apps, products, features, or services that are similar to your App or compete with your App.
            
        
    *   **iii. _Your Name, Trademarks, and Logos:_** You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use your name, trademarks, and logos for distribution, marketing, and promotional purposes, in connection with your use of [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139), in all formats and media.

    *   iii.

We have provided section headers for your convenience, but you should carefully read though these Terms in order to understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as ours.

This agreement was written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.

* * *

1.  ### Transactions
    
    1.  Eligibility . We may approve or deny your request to integrate Facebook Payments at our sole discretion. You must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to integrate Facebook Payments in your app; in addition, you may not be listed as an administrator for a Payments-enabled app if you are under the age of sixteen (16). We may also revoke your eligibility to continue utilizing Facebook Payments at any time at our sole discretion.
      
    3.  Roles of parties
        1.  You accept responsibility for fulfilling each transaction pursuant to the terms you offer. Facebook is not involved in any underlying transaction between or among developers and users except as noted in Section 3.9 of these Terms.
          
        3.  You appoint Meta Payments Inc. (“MPY”) as your limited payment collection agent for the sole purpose of accepting payment on your behalf from users for content you offer on Facebook and, depending on the region, applicable taxes and fees.
            
            You agree that:
            
            1.  Payment made by a user to MPY constitutes payment made directly to you and fully satisfies the user’s obligation to you for that payment, and you must fulfill your obligations to the user as if you had received the payment directly from the user;
              
            3.  MPY is responsible for remitting to you any payments received from users on your behalf, less any amounts payable to MPY or any of its affiliates pursuant to these Terms; and
              
            5.  If MPY does not remit any amounts received from users on your behalf which are due to you in accordance with these Terms, you will only have recourse against MPY.
      
    5.  Pricing . Price-setting in apps is governed by the following rules:
        1.  You may price items for sale in your own local currency where such pricing is supported.
          
        3.  You may not price an item differently based on a user’s electronic value Balance.
          
        5.  You may allow users to import your in-game virtual currency or items from your website or other platform that the user is connected to, but you must adhere to the following:
            1.  You must offer the same price on Facebook that you offer to logged-in Facebook users on your own website or other platform app; and
              
            3.  You may not incentivize logged-in Facebook users to make a purchase on your website or in an app on another platform by, for example, providing free or discounted goods or services that are not available to purchasers on Facebook.
              
            
          
        
    6.  Prohibitions . Facebook Payments does not allow the following types of transactions:
        1.  You may not conduct a transaction for which the promotion or execution is prohibited on Facebook.
          
        3.  You may not utilize Facebook Payments to sell virtual currency or other stored-value items that can be used outside of the app where the transaction was completed, and must not allow users to cash out, redeem, or otherwise receive anything of value in exchange for anything purchased using Facebook Payments. In addition, you may not accept electronic value from a user in one app and then deliver or transfer the purchased item to the user in another app without our prior authorization. For example, an app solely designed to facilitate transactions is not permitted.
          
        5.  Except as a method of purchasing within your app in accordance with these Terms or with our prior written authorization, you may not sell, trade, or exchange electronic value, including without limitation Gift Card balances, with any third party, nor may you enable or allow others to do so.
          
        7.  Except with our prior authorization, you may not accept payments for tangible goods, including as payment for anything that may subsequently be used to acquire tangible goods, defined as any good that is physically delivered to a user.
          
        9.  Except with our prior authorization, you may not use Facebook Payments to solicit, collect, or transfer funds for charitable causes.
          
        11.  Any items, virtual currency, or services you offer on or through Facebook are considered to be content or apps posted by you to Facebook under the [Statement of Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php)  
            . You may not offer any items, virtual currency, or services on or through Facebook that require consent or other rights from any third party unless you have obtained all such rights. You may not offer any item, virtual currency, or service that would require us to pay any fee or royalty to any third party. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of or related to your failure to comply with this paragraph.
          
        13.  Except with our prior authorization, you may not administer a promotion on Facebook in which a user's purchase of in-game items or virtual currency contributes to or results in eligibility to win any prize of value. To request permission, please [contact us](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/?id=346394612108964) and include an opinion letter from your legal counsel that explains why your game does not constitute gambling and instead is a lawful activity in all jurisdictions where the promotion is available to users.
          
        
      
    8.  Non-disclosure . You will not use or disclose any user’s payment information obtained from us for any purpose other than to complete the transaction for which the information was obtained.
      
    10.  Other terms apply . You may offer supplemental terms and conditions in conjunction with your sales; however they may not conflict with Facebook terms or policies. You must comply with Facebook’s [Brand Asset Guidelines](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebookbrand.com%2F&h=AT1ZLuZHXiywOi3CJirdgSCSqCToLlD_pJisTrPhjv2TV-NKTcwdgho95GkNWnr9ndZdqwflq5vDrpevlyzLC6URMRdrhH6dZY8lMClHypYt4af-s7vZgy0rYQZX-PYQyssE8wYTOvjVTbqSKy-erMY3h8c) .
      
    
2.  ### Balance Tracking
    
      
    2.  Developer Balance . Developers using Facebook Payments will have a Developer Balance with Facebook. Whenever you complete a sale on our platform, Facebook will credit the proceeds from that sale, less our service fee, to your Developer Balance. Facebook will earn a 30% service fee, plus any applicable sales tax or VAT, in connection with each Facebook Payments transaction on our platform.
      
    4.  Nature of Service . Facebook is not a bank and does not offer banking services. You will not earn interest on your Developer Balance. Developer Balances are not deposit obligations and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, or any other entity or insurance scheme, whether governmental or private. All Developer Balances are held and expressed in United States Dollars; if your transaction was in a different currency, proceeds from the sale will be converted at the time of the transaction according to the day’s published exchange rate before being credited to your Developer Balance.
      
    6.  Payout . We will redeem your Developer Balance according to the following rules:
          
        2.  We can redeem your Developer Balance only if we have your current banking information and any other information we need to make the payment on record, including, if required, identification and tax and business formation documentation. A list of our current payout methods is posted [on our site](https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=198118756901516) .
          
        4.  We will make Developer Balance redemption payments only to the account entered by the developer in the Payout Information field of the Developer’s [Company Settings](https://developers.facebook.com/settings?tab=payments).
          
        6.  Facebook will redeem your Developer Balance approximately 21 days following the end of the bimonthly period (either the 1st through 15th of the month or the 16th through the end of the month) in which the transaction occurred, except as otherwise set forth herein.
          
        8.  Developer Balances will be redeemed only in United States Dollars.
          
        10.  If a Developer Balance redemption payment for any given pay period would be less than One Hundred United States Dollars ($100.00), we will roll payment over to the next month, unless your account is being deactivated or deleted, or if it has been one year since either your last redemption payment or your first use of Facebook Payments or Credits.
          
        12.  We may delay payout related to any investigation we are conducting, but in no case longer than 180 days after the transaction.
          
        14.  We may withhold from redemption any Developer Balance or portion thereof that was earned due to any breach of any Facebook terms or policies by you, or that was transferred based on fraudulent or illegal transactions, or that was alleged by a user to have been transferred without his or her consent, or that resulted in returned, undelivered, rejected, or defective goods or services or transactions.
          
        16.  We may deduct from payout any amounts for which you are past due to Facebook on any payment in connection with any Facebook program.
          
        18.  If you owe Facebook an amount exceeding your Developer Balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered with your account to cover the amount owed. Your failure to pay fully any amounts owed to Facebook on demand will be a violation of these Terms, and you will be liable not only for the amount collected but also for Facebook’s costs associated with collection, including without limitation attorney fees, court costs, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.
          
        20.  As further described in Section 3.9 of these Terms, it is your responsibility to remit all duties, taxes (including without limitation sales tax and VAT) and other fees that apply to your transactions, including the redemption of any Developer Balance. Facebook complies with tax and legal informational reporting requirements in various jurisdictions.
          
        
    7.  Discrepancies . If Facebook makes a redemption payment to you in error, you are liable for the full amount of that payout. You agree to reverse the payment associated with that redemption or to permit Facebook to reverse the payment. You must provide written notification of any disputed payout within 30 days of receipt of the associated payment. Failure to do so constitutes a waiver by you of any claim relating to the payout.
      
    9.  Abandoned Property . If we are unable to pay you because you have not provided valid payment information or, where required, valid identification information, we may terminate your ability to maintain your Developer Balance to the extent permissible by law, and process any remaining Developer Balance in accordance with applicable law.
      
    
3.  ### Your Responsibilities and Risks
    
      
    2.  Voidability . You acknowledge that transactions with minors may be voidable by law and agree that you may be required to refund amounts paid.
      
    4.  Dispute resolution . You are solely responsible for the resolution of disputes between yourself and users, including without limitation disputes that we refer to you or notify you of via tools or systems we may provide. We have the right, but not the obligation, to assist in the resolution of such disputes.
      
    6.  Cooperation . You agree to provide us with any records that we request related to a dispute between you and a user. You agree to notify us in a timely manner if you receive an inquiry from any government agency about Facebook Payments.

    10.  No Liability . We will not be liable to you for compensation, reimbursement, or damages on account of the loss of prospective profits, anticipated sales, or goodwill, or on account of expenditures, investments, or commitments in connection with your use of Facebook Payments, or for any termination or suspension of Facebook Payments services.
      
    12.  Subscriptions . If you offer subscriptions to your app or to a feature within your app, you must continue to make the app or feature available to subscribed users through the end of any active subscription period, or refund any remaining subscriptions on a pro-rated basis.
      
    14.  Chargebacks . You will be liable for all Chargebacks relating to transactions discovered within 90 days of the transaction. By “Chargebacks” we mean any reversals of payment initiated by a third-party payment provider. We will assume responsibility for Chargebacks discovered after the 90th day unless: (a) we determine you conducted the transaction in connection with a breach of Facebook rules or policies, or (b) your Chargeback rate for any one of the prior three months exceeds five percent of your total transaction volume for that month.
      
    16.  Offset . If we provide refunds or other compensation to a user as a result of either the user’s transaction with you using Facebook Payments or any claims made by third parties arising from your products or services, then you agree that we may recover from you any monetary loss related to such provision.
      
    18.  Taxes . The following rules regarding taxes apply:
          
        2.  If you are a U.S.-based developer, you acknowledge that Facebook in tax year 2011 began reporting to the Internal Revenue Service on IRS Form 1099K the gross amount of the payments you receive each calendar year if, in that calendar year, you (i) receive more than $20,000 and (ii) receive more than 200 payments. If duties, taxes, or fees apply to the redemption of a Developer Balance, we may adjust the service fee so that the net amount we receive remains at 30%. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of or related to your failure to comply with this paragraph.
          
        4.  On your sales to users based in the European Union (EU) member countries, we will withhold from your payout and remit applicable EU VAT based on user locations to relevant competent tax authorities. You also acknowledge and accept Facebook's self-billing arrangement where it is accepted under local VAT regulation. Effective January 1, 2017, we will begin to withhold from your payout and remit applicable VAT or GST based on user locations to relevant tax authorities in the following countries: New Zealand, Russia, and South Korea. Effective July 1, 2017, we will do the same for Australia. Effective from 1 May 2018, we will do same for Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. You further acknowledge that Facebook's compliance with this change in laws in these countries does not change the relationship, rights and obligations between you and user, or between you and Facebook. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of or related to your failure to comply with this paragraph.
